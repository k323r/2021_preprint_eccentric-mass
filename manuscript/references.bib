  abstract = {Current installation costs of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are high and profit margins in the offshore wind energy sector are low, it is thus necessary to develop installation methods that are more efficient and practical. This paper presents a numerical study (based on a global response analysis of marine operations) of a novel procedure for installing the tower and Rotor Nacelle Assemblies (RNAs) on bottom-fixed foundations of OWTs. The installation procedure is based on the inverted pendulum principle. A cargo barge is used to transport the OWT assembly in a horizontal position to the site, and a medium-size Heavy Lift Vessel (HLV) is then employed to lift and up-end the OWT assembly using a special upending frame. The main advantage of this novel procedure is that the need for a huge HLV (in terms of lifting height and capacity) is eliminated. This novel method requires that the cargo barge is in the leeward side of the HLV (which can be positioned with the best heading) during the entire installation. This is to benefit from shielding effects of the HLV on the motions of the cargo barge, so the foundations need to be installed with a specific heading based on wave direction statistics of the site and a typical installation season. Following a systematic approach based on numerical simulations of actual operations, potential critical installation activities, corresponding critical events, and limiting (response) parameters are identified. In addition, operational limits for some of the limiting parameters are established in terms of allowable limits of sea states. Following a preliminary assessment of these operational limits, the duration of the entire operation, the equipment used, and weather-and water depth-sensitivity, this novel procedure is demonstrated to be viable.},

  abstract = {Dynamic stall phenomena carry the risk of negative damping and instability in wind turbine blades. It is crucial to model these phenomena accurately to reduce inaccuracies in predicting design driving (fatigue and extreme) loads. Some of the inaccuracies in current dynamic stall models may be due to the fact that they are not properly designed for high angles of attack and that they do not specifically describe vortex shedding behaviour. The Snel second-order dynamic stall model attempts to explicitly model unsteady vortex shedding. This model could therefore be a valuable addition to a turbine design software such as Bladed. In this paper the model has been validated with oscillating aerofoil experiments, and improvements have been proposed for reducing inaccuracies. The proposed changes led to an overall reduction in error between the model and experimental data. Furthermore the vibration frequency prediction improved significantly. The improved model has been implemented in Bladed and tested against small-scale turbine experiments at parked conditions. At high angles of attack the model looks promising for reducing mismatches between predicted and measured (fatigue and extreme) loading, leading to possible lower safety factors for design and more cost-efficient designs for future wind turbines.},

With increasing size and clustering, offshore wind farms (OWFs) wake effects, which alter wind conditions and decrease the power generation efficiency of wind farms downwind become more important. We use a high-resolution regional climate model with implemented wind farm parameterizations to explore offshore wind energy production limits in the North Sea. We simulate near future wind farm scenarios considering existing and planned OWFs in the North Sea and assess power generation losses and wind variations due to wind farm wake. The annual mean wind speed deficit within a wind farm can reach 2\textendash 2.5~ms-1 depending on the wind farm geometry. The mean deficit, which decreases with distance, can extend 35\textendash 40~km downwind during prevailing southwesterly winds. Wind speed deficits are highest during spring (mainly March\textendash April) and lowest during November\textendash December. The large-size of wind farms and their proximity affect not only the performance of its downwind turbines but also that of neighboring downwind farms, reducing the capacity factor by 20\% or more, which increases energy production costs and economic losses. We conclude that wind energy can be a limited resource in the North Sea. The limits and potentials for optimization need to be considered in climate mitigation strategies and cross-national optimization of offshore energy production plans are inevitable.},

The numerical simulations are conducted at a fixed Reynolds number, R=200, and at displacement amplitude-to-cylinder diameter of A=0.1 and 0.3. Results show the existence of symmetric/asymmetric modes of vortex formation in the cylinder wake at different values of unsteady loading on the cylinder, which is characterized by the ratio of oscillation frequency, f, to K\'arm\'an vortex-shedding frequency, f0. For this paper, the frequency ratio is chosen from f/f0=0.5 to 3, where switching from asymmetric to symmetric vortex shedding is observed. The relation between these vortex-shedding modes and fluid forces on the cylinder surface is discussed. An analysis of the locked-on modes via Lissajous patterns of unsteady lift coefficient is also included. Previously computed and observed flow fields as well as fluid forces are compared to current numerical results and agreement is found to be excellent.},

Wind energy is one of potential alternative for generating electricity in Malaysia. The offshore wind speed is better compared to onshore, so there is more potential contribution by offshore wind power in terms of electricity generation. This paper provides a summary of the offshore wind resources of the Kijal, Malaysia by analyzing the QuikSCAT satellite data which is available and can be downloaded from the WindPRO application. Based on these datasets, wind resources are assessed, and economical efficiency is evaluated by means of the expected capacity factor. Research was conducted using WindPRO and WAsP software to assess the potential of wind energy along the South China Sea in Kijal, Terengganu. Seven models of the wind turbines with different rated power; 110kW, 225kW, 275kW, 600kW, 850kW, 1000kW and 1250kW are taken for energy and economic feasibility analyses. The wind turbine with rated power 850 kW was indicated as the best wind turbine for installation in Kijal based on its best capacity factor, 26.8\% In economical aspect, Malaysia does not have Feed in Tariff (FiT) rates for offshore wind projects, thus the range of predicted FiT rates, RM 0.30 to RM 2.00 were tested by using Net Present Value (NPV) and Payback Period (PBP) calculation. Finally, the conducive FiT rates for wind projects with secured investment were identified and the rates were in range RM 0.80 to RM 1.38. The overall results suggest that the wind energy has a bright future for use as an alternative source for generating electricity in Kijal, Malaysia.},

  abstract = {A cylinder in cross-flow experiences periodic forcing related to the shedding of vortices in its wake. Long wires in the ocean vibrate in response to this forcing, but their length and damping is such that boundary conditions do not generally apply to solutions of the equations of motion and their vibratory behavior at one point is of little consequence at remote points. The bulk of previous studies of vibrating wire characteristics have utilized only short wires or cylinders in the laboratory, so have not considered or even permitted this phenomenon. During a typical deployment of the Scripps Deep-Tow survey system to 2800 m a small 2-axis accelerometer package was attached to the tow wire at a depth of 30 m and its output recorded in a diver-operated vehicle about 1 m downstream. Analysis of this data produced sharply peaked spectra with the frequencies of vibration in the direction of flow twice those across the flow. Good correlations were found between mean amplitudes across the flow and the corresponding peak frequencies, and between mean amplitudes across and aligned with the flow. Preference for a specific phase relation between motions in the two planes suggests that vortex shedding occurs progressively and forcing has the form of a complex wave travelling down the wire. To investigate the implications of the preceding, a tow-tank fixture was built which permitted reproduction of amplitude, frequency and phase relations in a cylinder representing a point on the wire. A series of runs were then made to measure drag force directly and obtain an empirical drag law. A constant drag coefficient of 1.8 was found in the Reynolds number range 7000\textendash 12000, contrary to other investigations that have ignored vibrations in the flow direction.},

A robust control scheme needs to be considered to maintain them in a safe operational limit. Robust sliding mode control (SMC) scheme can provide an excellent robust controller against this severe and challenging environment for these chaotic structures. This paper proposes a novel fixed-time adaptive sliding mode control scheme with a state observer to synchronize chaotic support structures for offshore wind turbines in the presence of matched parametric uncertainties. The proposed controller is a new integration of adaptive control concept, SMC method, fixed-time stability concept and a state observer. A fixed-time stability concept is used to provide stability for the system within a presented time regardless of initial conditions. The adaptive concept is utilized to provide an online estimator of the uncertain upper bound. Also, a nonlinear observer is employed to provide an online estimator of an unmeasured state in the controller. Lyapunov stability theorem is used to analyze fixedtime stability of the system based on SMC methodology. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller is able to ensure fixed-time synchronization along with providing precise means to estimate the unmeasured state as well as uncertainty upper bound.},

Moreover, the paper presents a methodology to derive a simplified model of the hybrid energy system that reduces simulation time in at least two orders of magnitude. The latter can be a useful tool for optimization algorithms evaluating a huge number of scenarios, especially those dealing with economical dispatch of generators or sizing of energy storage systems.},

  title = {Analytic Signal},
  year = {2020},
  month = dec,
  abstract = {In mathematics and signal processing, an analytic signal is a complex-valued function that has no negative frequency components.  The real and imaginary parts of an analytic signal are real-valued functions related to each other by the Hilbert transform. The analytic representation of a real-valued function is an analytic signal, comprising the original function and its Hilbert transform.  This representation facilitates many mathematical manipulations. The basic idea is that the negative frequency components of the Fourier transform (or spectrum) of a real-valued function are superfluous, due to the Hermitian symmetry of such a spectrum. These negative frequency components can be discarded with no loss of information, provided one is willing to deal with a complex-valued function instead. That makes certain attributes of the function more accessible and facilitates the derivation of modulation and demodulation techniques, such as single-sideband.  As long as the manipulated function has no negative frequency components (that is, it is still analytic), the conversion from complex back to real is just a matter of discarding the imaginary part. The analytic representation is a generalization of the phasor concept: while the phasor is restricted to time-invariant amplitude, phase, and frequency, the analytic signal allows for time-variable parameters.},

Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Bayesian hyperparameters calibration is proposed to obtain a surrogate from input random variables to output DELs in the blades and towers of the up-wind and wake-affected wind turbines. A sensitivity analysis based on the hyperparameters of the GPR and Kullback-Leibler divergence is conducted to assess the effect of different input on the obtained DELs. We provide qualitative recommendations for a Journal Pre-proof minimal set of necessary and sufficient input random variables to minimize the error in the DEL predictions on the wake-affected wind turbine. Extensive simulations are performed comprising different random variables, including wind speed, turbulence intensity, shear exponent and inflow horizontal skewness. Furthermore, we include random variables related to the blades lift and drag coefficients with direct impact on the rotor aerodynamic induction, which governs the evolution and transport of the meandering wake. In addition, different spacing between the wind turbines and W\"ohler exponents for calculation of DELs are considered. The maximum prediction normalized mean squared error, obtained in the tower base DELs in the fore-aft direction of the wake affected wind turbine, is less than 4\%. In the case of the blade root DELs, the overall prediction error is less than 1\%. The proposed scheme promotes utilization of sparse structural monitoring (loads) measurements for improving diagnostics on wake-affected turbines.},

An assessment of the experimental results for the response amplitude operator for regular waves and the 90th percentile seabed bending moment in long-crested irregular waves is carried out using two models (analytical and numerical) for uncertainty propagation, suggesting that bias errors in the model properties and in the wave elevation contribute the most to the total uncertainty. The experimental results are also compared to a numerical model using beam elements and Morison-type wave loads with second order wave kinematics. The numerical model does not capture all of the responses within the level of uncertainty of the experiments, and possible reasons for the discrepancies are discussed.},

Different vessels, ports and weather restrictions over a fixed time horizon are considered in the model. Several deterministic test cases with historic weather data are implemented in AMPL, and run with the CPLEX solver. The results provide valuable insight into economic impact of strategic decisions. Numerical experiments on instances indicate that decision aid could be more reliable if large OWFs are considered in fractionated parts, alternatively by developing heuristics.},

The Navier\textendash Stokes equations, pressure Poisson equations and continuity are written in primitive variables in a noninertial system fixed to the orbiting cylinder and solved by the finite difference method. Ellipticity values between 0 and 1.2 (from pure in-line oscillation through a full circle and beyond) were investigated. Sudden changes in state (jumps) are found when time-mean or root-mean-square values of force coefficients or energy transfer are plotted against ellipticity. Pre- and post-jump analysis was carried out by investigating limit cycles, time-histories, phase angles and flow patterns. These investigations revealed that ellipticity can have a large effect on the energy transfer between the incompressible fluid and a circular cylinder forced to follow an orbital path, and that small changes in the amplitude of transverse motion can have a dramatic effect. The phase angle was altered by about 180\textdegree{} at the jumps. Also investigated were the direction of orbit, which affects the state curves belonging to the time-mean values of lift only, and the effect of initial conditions, which alters the location of jumps without changing the state curves.},

The influence of Reynolds number on the response of isolated cylinders is presented and recent developments using forced vibration are discussed. The response of a cylinder free to respond in the in-line and transverse directions is contrasted with that of a cylinder responding in only one direction. The interference between two circular cylinders is discussed and prominence given to the case of cylinders in a tandem arrangement.

Experiments were carried out in water with mass ratios in a range from about 1.5 to 5.5 and combined mass and damping values between about 2\texttimes 10-3 and 7\texttimes 10-3. Reynolds numbers were within the range 103 to 104. Although the wakes of fixed cylinders with strakes or bumps show little or no evidence of regular vortex shedding it was found to establish itself across a range of reduced velocity when the mass and damping parameters are sufficiently small. However, the amplitudes of vibration were less than those for a plain cylinder. It is observed that the modes of shedding found for an oscillating plain cylinder are also present for a responding cylinder fitted with vortex suppression devices.},

At larger times, the vortex dislocations appear spontaneously and destroy the spanwise periodicity in the flow. This confirms the hypothesis that the fully developed mode-A flow structures cannot exist without vortex dislocations. The appearance of dislocations leads to time variation in the vortex shedding frequency. They also lead to a reduction in the global aerodynamic parameters such as drag coefficient, rms value of lift coefficient, and dominant vortex shedding frequency. The vortex dislocations repetitively appear and disappear from the flow. The aerodynamic coefficients achieve a relatively lower value at the time instant when vortex dislocations appear in the flow. This leads to a low frequency modulation in the time variation of aerodynamic coefficients. The onset of mode-A is hysteretic. This is demonstrated in the present work via computations perhaps for the first time for increasing and decreasing Re. The transition from mode-A to mode-B vortex structures is gradual and not hysteretic. Mode-B is devoid of vortex dislocations and, therefore, the aerodynamic coefficients achieve a relatively larger value. The discontinuity in the variation of aerodynamic coefficients with Re is captured very well by the present computations. Unlike mode-A, the flow structures of the mode-B instability are restricted to the near wake.},

  abstract = {One of the possible multi uses of marine space is offshore wind farms and open water aquaculture plans. Unlike coastal installations, offshore wind farms allow for increased availability of wind power and wind persistence, as well as lower visual impact of the turbines. Existing offshore wind farms offer important advantages for aquaculture plans especially in terms of lack of major physical constrains, e.g., navigation routes, submarine cables, marine protected areas. Moreover, enhanced current velocity due to the presence of the piles and to the air fluxes of the turbines may increase the environmental suitability of aquaculture plans in these areas. In addition, the transmission of localized depleted water masses or waste material towards near-shore zones can be avoided, excluding potential impact close to the coast. On the other hand, other environmental constrains (e.g. temperature and salinity variability, dissolved oxygen concentrations, phytoplankton dynamics) need also to be considered when planning aquaculture activities. In this context, the present paper gives a contribution towards the definition of a sustainability index for the large scale localization of marine areas as offshore wind farms and aquaculture plans. This index is developed on the basis of a Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) technique, already used in open water aquaculture localization: raw data were converted to suitability scores, which were combined using additive models, in order to define the overall suitability. A detailed analysis of the environmental suitability is performed for few specific test cases at offshore wind farms located in the Denmark coastal zone, for which some projects of offshore aquaculture plans have been proposed. The use of this sustainability index will perform quantitative evaluations of the degree of compatibility between the offshore wind farms and the open water aquaculture, highlighting the main problems which can rise by the integration of both technologies.},

  abstract = {Although, offshore wind energy development emerged under way at the beginning of the millennium, Europe is planning to bring offshore wind energy capacity to over 11.6 GW until 2020. This is nearly 10 times todays installed offshore capacity and equal to nearly 50\% of the new planned investment in the wind energy market. The North Sea and the Baltic Sea are the main investment areas due to the shallower sea depth. In this paper an approach to use old gas / oil platforms as the foundation for a wind turbine is examined. An off shore gas platform close to Istanbul Turkey with over 20 years more lifetime is taken as a real-life case, with the wind resource information extracted from the recent large-scale wind atlas study, Global Wind Atlas version 2. The study aims to combine recent offshore economical models with up-to-date scientific wind energy yield assessment models to have a more realistic look on the feasibility of such an approach. The results show that, with the assumption of no extra support structure and capital loan costs, a project can be feasible with bigger then 8MW wind turbines. These may involve a large initial investment but the return of the investment (ROI) can be as low as 8 years. With bigger turbines, profit can be increased, and ROI can be decreased while the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) displays minor decrease after 10 MW.},

  abstract = {Measurements are presented of fluid-dynamic instability of a smooth circular cylinder, free to oscillate laterally against linear springs in the wake from an identical stationary neighbouring body. The observations also encompassed determination of static forces on the downstream cylinder as functions of relative position of the cylinder pair. Most of the experiments were performed under two conditions of free-stream turbulence. Static tests indicated that both the drag coefficient and the Strouhal number of the downstream body are continuous functions of its relative position. The drag forces were found to be negative at small gaps. It was observed that the transverse extent of the force field increases with increasing streamwise gap.In the dynamic experiments, depending on the cylinders' separation and structural damping, the cylinder exhibited a vortex-resonance, or a galloping, or a combined vortex-resonance and galloping, or a separated vortex-resonance and galloping. Whilst the characteristics of wake-excited motion were found to be essentially unaffected by a limited change in free-stream turbulence intensity, the galloping amplitudes were observed to be sensitive to the cylinders' aspect ratio. An increase in the stability parameter caused significant effects on the cylinder response in amplitude domain. Wake observations behind the oscillating body indicated that in vortex lock-in the frequency of vortex-shedding locked to vibration frequency, but during small-amplitude galloping motion the shedding frequency behaved as if the cylinder was stationary.},

All theoretical calculations employ hydrodynamic coefficients, in particular the drag coefficient for which a review of the literature is provided. An original scheme is proposed, based on the influence of transverse velocity, which can account for the apparent increase in the drag coefficient of a submerged cylinder undergoing vibration as a result of hydrodynamic forces. Several applications are presented which show that the use of empiric values for the drag coefficient of a cylinder vibrating on the order of 1.8 is still perfectly justified.},

  abstract = {A slender flexible body immersed in sheared cross-flow may exhibit vortex-induced vibrations (VIVs) involving a wide range of excited frequencies and structural wavenumbers. The mechanisms of broadband VIVs of a cylindrical tensioned beam of length-to-diameter aspect ratio 200 placed in shear flow, with an exponentially varying profile along the span, are investigated by means of direct numerical simulation. The Reynolds number is equal to 330 based on the maximum velocity, for comparison with previous work on narrowband vibrations in linear shear flow. The flow is found to excite the structure at a number of different locations under a condition of wake\textendash body synchronization, or lock-in. Broadband responses are associated with a distributed occurrence of the lock-in condition along the span, as opposed to the localized lock-in regions limited to the high inflow velocity zone, reported for narrowband vibrations in sheared current. Despite the instantaneously multi-frequency nature of broadband responses, the lock-in phenomenon remains a locally mono-frequency event, since the vortex formation is generally synchronized with a single vibration frequency at a given location. The spanwise distribution of the excitation zones induces travelling structural waves moving in both directions; this contrasts with the narrowband case where the direction of propagation toward decreasing inflow velocity is preferred. A generalization of the mechanism of phase-locking between the in-line and cross-flow responses is proposed for broadband VIVs under the lock-in condition. A spanwise drift of the in-line/cross-flow phase difference is identified for the high-wavenumber vibration components; this drift is related to the strong travelling wave character of the corresponding structural waves.},

Three types of responses are considered, mono-frequency, narrowband, and broadband multi-frequency vibrations; in all cases, in-line and cross-flow vibration components occurring with a frequency ratio of 2 are phase-locked within regions of wake-body synchronization. The in-line/cross-flow phase difference exhibits a persistent spanwise drift when vibration components present significant traveling-wave behavior; this drift depends linearly on the in-line/cross-flow wavenumber difference, controlled by the beam non-linear dispersion relation and also impacted by the effective added mass variability.},

  abstract = {We investigate the in-line and cross-flow vortex-induced vibrations of a long cylindrical tensioned beam, with length to diameter ratio L/D = 200, placed within a linearly sheared oncoming flow, using three-dimensional direct numerical simulation. The study is conducted at three Reynolds numbers, from 110 to 1100 based on maximum velocity, so as to include the transition to turbulence in the wake. The selected tension and bending stiffness lead to high-wavenumber vibrations, similar to those encountered in long ocean structures. The resulting vortex-induced vibrations consist of a mixture of standing and travelling wave patterns in both the in-line and cross-flow directions; the travelling wave component is preferentially oriented from high to low velocity regions. The in-line and cross-flow vibrations have a frequency ratio approximately equal to 2. Lock-in, the phenomenon of self-excited vibrations accompanied by synchronization between the vortex shedding and cross-flow vibration frequencies, occurs in the high-velocity region, extending across 30\% or more of the beam length. The occurrence of lock-in disrupts the spanwise regularity of the cellular patterns observed in the wake of stationary cylinders in shear flow. The wake exhibits an oblique vortex shedding pattern, inclined in the direction of the travelling wave component of the cylinder vibrations. Vortex splittings occur between spanwise cells of constant vortex shedding frequency. The flow excites the cylinder under the lock-in condition with a preferential in-line versus cross-flow motion phase difference corresponding to counter-clockwise, figure-eight orbits; but it damps cylinder vibrations in the non-lock-in region. Both mono-frequency and multi-frequency responses may be excited. In the case of multi-frequency response and within the lock-in region, the wake can lock in to different frequencies at various spanwise locations; however, lock-in is a locally mono-frequency event, and hence the flow supplies energy to the structure mainly at the local lock-in frequency.},

  abstract = {, Cavitating flow over a circular cylinder is investigated over a range of cavitation numbers ( {$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{\sigma}$}=5\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D70E\}=5  to  0.50.5 ) for both laminar (at Reynolds number  (Re)=200(Re)=200 ) and turbulent (at  Re=3900Re=3900 ) regimes. We observe non-cavitating, cyclic and transitional cavitation regimes with reduction in free-stream  {$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{\sigma}\backslash$}unicode[STIX]\{x1D70E\} . The cavitation inside the K\'arm\'an vortices in the cyclic regime, is significantly altered by the onset of `condensation front' propagation in the transitional regime. At the transition, an order of magnitude jump in shedding Strouhal number ( StSt ) is observed as the dominant frequency shifts from periodic vortex shedding in the cyclic regime, to irregular\textendash regular vortex shedding in the transitional regime. In addition, a peak in pressure fluctuations, and a maximum in  StSt  versus  {$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{\sigma}\backslash$}unicode[STIX]\{x1D70E\}  based on cavity length are observed at the transition. Shedding characteristics in each regime are discussed using dynamic mode decomposition. A numerical method based on the homogeneous mixture model, fully compressible formulation and finite rate mass transfer developed by Gnanaskandan \& Mahesh (Intl J. Multiphase Flow, vol.~70, 2015, pp.~22\textendash 34) is extended to include the effects of non-condensable gas (NCG). It is demonstrated that the condensation fronts observed in the transitional regime are supersonic (referred to as `condensation shocks'). In the presence of NCG, multiple condensation shocks in a given cycle are required for complete cavity condensation and detachment, as compared to a single condensation shock when only vapour is present. This is explained by the reduction in pressure ratio across the shock in the presence of NCG, effectively reducing its strength. In addition, at  {$\mathsl{\sigma}\mathsl{\sigma}$}=0.85\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D70E\}=0.85  (near transition from the cyclic to the transitional regime), the presence of NCG suppresses the low frequency irregular\textendash regular vortex shedding. Vorticity transport at  Re=3900Re=3900 , in the transitional regime, indicates that the region of attached cavity is nearly two-dimensional, with very low vorticity, affecting K\'arm\'an shedding in the near wake. Majority of vortex stretching/tilting and vorticity production is observed following the cavity trailing edge. In addition, the boundary-layer separation point is found to be strongly dependent on the amounts of vapour and gas in the free stream for both laminar and turbulent regimes.},

The system has a low damping ratio. The tandem and staggered arrangements have been considered. The separations investigated are typical of transmission line bundles and range from 7 to 25 diameters and Reynolds number ranges from 5 000 to 27 000. For the tandem cylinders, the results indicate that (a) the dynamic response of the downstream cylinder is no longer hysteretic, (b) the synchronization onset is at higher reduced velocities and (c) the synchronization region is wider than that of an isolated cylinder; this region is twice as large for a separation of 10 diameters and decreases with increasing spacing. Despite the absence of the hysteresis loop and its associated discontinuities, two vortex patterns are present around the resonance velocity. A small decrease of the maximum amplitude of oscillation with increasing spacing has also been observed, as well as a reduction of the velocity for which this maximum occurs. For separations of 7 and 8{$\cdot$}5 diameters, the leeward cylinder exhibits a combination of vortex-induced and wake-galloping oscillations. For the staggered arrangement, the increase of the stagger angle {$\beta$} reduces the synchronization onset velocity and the synchronization region and beyond {$\beta$}=20\textdegree, the downstream cylinder behaves as an isolated one.},

  abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

Typically, the most serious discrepancies are associated with flow separation. The tremendous ongoing increases in numerical simulation capability are changing and in many aspects have changed the function of the wind tunnel from a (scaled) ``predictor'' to a source of computational calibration/validation information with the computation then utilized as the flight prediction/scaling tool. Numerical simulations can increasingly include the influences of the various scaling issues. This wind tunnel role change has been occurring for decades as computational capability improves in all aspects. Additional issues driving this trend are the increasing cost (and time) disparity between physical experiments and computations, and increasingly stringent accuracy requirements.},

The majority of current developments, certainly in UK waters, have taken place in relatively shallow water and close to shore. This limits the scale of the engineering to relatively simple structures, such as those using monopile foundations, and these have been the most common design to date, in UK waters. However, as larger turbines are designed, or they are placed in deeper water, it will be necessary to use multi-footing structures such as tripods or jackets. For these designs, the tension on the upwind footing becomes the critical design condition. Driven pile foundations could be used, as could suction-installed foundations. However, in this paper, we present another concept-the use of helical pile foundations. These foundations are routinely applied onshore where large tension capacities are required. However, for use offshore, a significant upscaling of the technology will be needed, particularly of the equipment required for installation of the piles. A clear understanding of the relevant geotechnical engineering will be needed if this upscaling is to be successful.},

Two distinctly different wake states are observed. The emphasis is on the transition between these states, which is characterized in terms of the lift force on the cylinder and the instantaneous patterns of vortex structures in the near-wake. As the frequency of oscillation increases, there is simultaneously an abrupt jump in the lift force and a change in the mode of vortex shedding. The jump in the lift force involves a sharp increase in the magnitude of the lift coefficient and a phase shift of the order 180\textdegree. The corresponding mode change involves an alteration in both the timing of the vortex initially shed from the cylinder and the overall pattern of vortices in the near-wake. Whilst previously these changes have been observed individually in separate forced vibration investigations, we show conclusive evidence that these two events are intrinsically linked. Moreover, for a narrow band of frequencies, a self-excited transition is possible, where the wake state changes while the cylinder oscillates at a constant frequency.},

  abstract = {An experimental study of flow-induced oscillations of a floating model spar-type wind turbine platform was conducted. The model spar consisted of a floating uniform cylinder moored in a water tunnel test section and free to oscillate about its mooring attachment point near the center of mass. For the bare cylinder, periodic oscillations with figure-eight trajectories were observed over a range of reduced velocities, resembling a lock-in region. This was shown to be a vortex-induced vibration response since the oscillation frequencies and the shedding frequencies stayed equal to each other during the lock-in region. While the lower part of the cylinder was moving upstream at the 2 crossflow extremes of the trajectory, referred to as a counterclockwise (CCW) motion, its upper part experienced clockwise motion. It was hypothesized that the portion of the spar undergoing CCW figure eights is the portion where the flow excites the structure. This hypothesis was then validated by showing that adding helical strakes to the portion of the cylinder with CCW orbital motion suppresses vortex-induced vibration almost entirely, while adding strakes to the portion with clockwise orbital motion had a minimal influence on the amplitude of response.},

  abstract = {Wind farm operation reliability is becoming a key asset for wind energy conversion systems in the framework of grid-parity energy market. Consequently, experimental methods for characterizing the vibration behaviour of wind turbines in real operating conditions are going to play a fundamental role in order to improve the correct estimation of the RUL (Remaining Useful Life) of the components as well as the whole system. For this reason, in the present work a new experimental approach for the identification of the most important mechanical parameters through field acceleration measurements has been developed and tested on a full scale three bladed wind turbine with a rated power of 200 kW and a rotor diameter of 31 meters. The main goal of the identification procedure was to give the correct estimation of important vibration parameters of the structure and the machine. as for example the tower structural eigenfrequencies and the structural damping. The experimental setup included three accelerometers on the nacelle (two for the tower and one for the main bearing) and up to four sensors on along the tower and in the foundation. The structural eigeinfrenquencies have been studied through machine emergency stops while the operational condition were studied capturing steady-state events. The study demonstrates that the experimental data post-processing can represent a fruitful and quick approach for defining the most important structural and dynamic parameter even when the full details of the wind turbine are not available and this can be particularly useful for refurbished technology.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, some researchers and professionals have been engaged in the study of methods and techniques that can build high wind turbines while containing construction costs within the limits of economic convenience. Among the most promising solutions is that of using innovative devices to mitigate the structural demand for the towers. The reduction in the stress demand in the foundation makes the strategy particularly interesting for the repowering of existing plants, where it is convenient not to demolish and rebuild the foundation, but rather to reuse the existing one for the new plant. A semi-active vibration control strategy, based on the adoption of controllable dissipative devices, is presented herein. The proposed technique requires the tower to be equipped with a measurement system suitable for the real time monitoring of structural response. Performing reliable high-frequency measurements of the horizontal displacement of points located at heights of tens of meters is not simple. With the purpose of assessing the efficiency and feasibility of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based systems for the control of wind turbine structures, the proposed paper tries to investigate the characteristics and data processing techniques that are able to make the GNSS useful for such applications. Several numerical simulations were carried out with reference to a case-study wind turbine to quantitatively assess how the performance of the control system changes as the features of the monitoring system worsen, and finally to draw conclusions and suggestions for the minimum performance that monitoring devices must have for an effective reduction in structural demand.},

  abstract = {Shelf seas comprise approximately 7\% of the world's oceans and host enormous economic activity. Development of energy installations (e.g. Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs), tidal turbines) in response to increased demand for renewable energy requires a careful analysis of potential impacts. Recent remote sensing observations have identified kilometre-scale impacts from OWFs. Existing modelling evaluating monopile impacts has fallen into two camps: small-scale models with individually resolved turbines looking at local effects; and large-scale analyses but with sub-grid scale turbine parameterisations. This work straddles both scales through a 3D unstructured grid model (FVCOM): wind turbine monopiles in the eastern Irish Sea are explicitly described in the grid whilst the overall grid domain covers the south-western UK shelf. Localised regions of decreased velocity extend up to 250 times the monopile diameter away from the monopile. Shelf-wide, the amplitude of the M-2 tidal constituent increases by up to 7\%. The turbines enhance localised vertical mixing which decreases seasonal stratification. The spatial extent of this extends well beyond the turbines into the surrounding seas. With significant expansion of OWFs on continental shelves, this work highlights the importance of how OWFs may impact coastal (e.g. increased flooding risk) and offshore (e.g. stratification and nutrient cycling) areas.

A formula is included by which the approximate minimum radius of turn that does not precipitate collapse can be quickly calculated. Non-dimensional tables are presented giving details of the equilibrium configuration adopted by the cable when the ship maintains a circular course.

The research objective of this paper is to investigate unsteady aerodynamic characteristics of a FOWT under the pitch, yaw, and coupled pitch\textendash yaw platform motions using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method in the Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations. The pitch, yaw, and coupled pitch\textendash yaw motions are studied separately to analyze the platform motions' effects on the rotor blade. The accuracy of the numerical simulation method is verified, and the overall performances, including power and thrust, are discussed. In addition, the comparison of total aerodynamic performance, force coefficients at different spans and structural dynamic response is provided. The numerical simulation results show that the platform pitching is the main influencing factor of power fluctuation, and the average thrust values of the pitch, yaw, and coupled motions are consistent regardless of the frequency value. The angle of attack (AOA) of airfoils is much more sensitive to the yaw motion, while the blade normal and tangential forces are mainly affected by pitch motion. As for the structural response, the results suggest that the aerodynamic loads of the wind turbine are more sensitive to the pitch motion, which is confirmed by the thrust force and torque of each blade during the platform motions.},

Damping in an OWT originates from different sources, mainly, aerodynamic, structural, hydrodynamic and soil dampings. The difficulties in identifying the individual contribution from each damping source has led to considerable uncertainty and variation in the values recommended. This paper proposes simplified but direct modelling approaches to quantify the different damping contributions from the aerodynamic, hydrodynamic and soil interactions. Results from these models were systemically compared to published values and when appropriate with simulation results from the software package FAST. The range of values obtained for aerodynamic damping confirmed those available in the literature and Blade Element Modelling theory was shown to provide good results relatively efficiently. The influence of couplings between fore-aft and side-side directions on the aerodynamic damping contribution was highlighted. The modelling of hydrodynamic damping showed that this damping is much smaller than usually recommended and could be safely ignored for OWTs. Soil damping strongly depends on the soil specific nonlinear behaviour.},

The results indicate that the VIV oscillation amplitudes and frequency lock-in ranges of the controlled models are smaller than those of the baseline case. In addition to the vibration measurements, the pressure distribution in the test model is measured with a digital pressure measurement system. According to the surface pressure results, the mean pressures of the leeward surface are lifted, and the root-mean-square (RMS) pressures on the cylinder surface are suppressed compared with those of the baseline case. Moreover, in the controlled cases, the mean drag and lift fluctuations are remarkably alleviated, and the Reynolds shear stress in the cylinder wake decreases considerably. All results indicate that the effectiveness of the passive-jet flow control in this investigation is determined by the spacing of two neighboring jet pipes. Moreover, a linear correlation analysis of the surface pressures reveals that the correlation of the external surface pressure is tremendously disturbed by the passive-jet flow control.},

  abstract = {A numerical study of the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a flexible supported circular cylinder using the direct-forcing immersed boundary (DFIB) method incorporating the virtual force term is investigated. The use of DFIB method eliminates the requirement of mesh regeneration at each time step, owing to the movement of the cylinder, a practice which is common with body-fitted grid setups. The fluctuating hydrodynamic forces may cause the vibration of the structure due to vortex shedding behind it. In reality, this vibration phenomenon may result in the failure of the structure especially for the so-called lock-in/ synchronization phenomenon. The present study shows that a dynamically mounted circular cylinder is allowed to vibrate transversely only or both in the in-line and the transverse directions in a uniform flow at a moderate Reynolds number. The effects of reduced velocity and gap ratio on VIV are discussed. Hydrodynamic coefficients of a freely vibrating cylinder are analyzed in time and spectral domains. The cylinder orbits the slightly oval-shaped and eight-shaped motions in the lock-in regime. Moreover, the 2S and the C(2S) vortex shedding modes can be found at the low amplitude vibration and the large amplitude vibration, respectively. The comparisons against the published data prove the capability of the present DFIB model. This proposed model can be useful for the investigation of VIV of the structures.},

The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the Galerkin procedure are used to derive a nonlinear distributed-parameter model for the BWTs under a fluctuating lift force due to periodically shedding vortices. The derived dynamic model is validated through comparison with a 3D CFD-FEM numerical simulation. The effects of the wind speed on the induced lift force, turbine deflection, and generated power of four BWTs are investigated. It is verified that the amplitude of the vibrations of the BWT increases significantly when the vortex shedding is synchronized with the structural oscillations. The results show that, while conic BWTs have a higher performance at post-synchronization region (i.e. high wind speeds), the right circular cylinder BWTs exhibits a better performance at pre-synchronization region (i.e. low wind speeds).},

  month = jan,
  abstract = {In mathematics (in particular, functional analysis), convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions (f and g) that produces a third function (                        f         {${_\ast}$}         g                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle f*g\}   ) that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other.  The term convolution refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted.  And the integral is evaluated for all values of shift, producing the convolution function. Some features of convolution are similar to cross-correlation: for real-valued functions, of a continuous or discrete variable, it differs from cross-correlation (                        f         {$\star$}         g                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle f\textbackslash star g\}   ) only in that either f(x) or g(x) is reflected about the y-axis; thus it is a cross-correlation of f(x) and g(-x), or f(-x) and g(x).  For complex-valued functions, the cross-correlation operator is the adjoint of the convolution operator. Convolution has applications that include probability, statistics, acoustics, spectroscopy, signal processing and image processing, engineering, physics, computer vision and differential equations.The convolution can be defined for functions on Euclidean space and other groups. For example, periodic functions, such as the discrete-time Fourier transform, can be defined on a circle and convolved by periodic convolution. (See row 18 at DTFT \textsection{} Properties.) A discrete convolution can be defined for functions on the set of integers. Generalizations of convolution have applications in the field of numerical analysis and numerical linear algebra, and in the design and implementation of finite impulse response filters in signal processing.Computing the inverse of the convolution operation is known as deconvolution.},

  abstract = {The calculated response of a uniform beam to stationary random excitation depends greatly on the dynamical model postulated, on the damping mechanism assumed, and on the nature of the random excitation process. To illustrate this, the mean square deflections, slopes, bending moments, and shear forces have been compared for four different dynamical models, with three different damping mechanisms, subjected to a distributed transverse loading process which is uncorrelated spacewise and which is either ideally ``white'' timewise or band-limited with an upper cut-off frequency. The dynamic models are the Bernoulli-Euler beam, the Timoshenko beam, and two intermediate models, the Rayleigh beam, and a beam which has the shear flexibility of the Timoshenko beam but not the rotatory inertia. The damping mechanisms are transverse viscous damping, rotatory viscous damping, and Voigt viscoelasticity. It is found that many of the mean-square response quantities are finite when the excitation is ideally white (i.e., when the input has infinite mean square); however, some of the responses are unbounded. For these cases the rate of growth of the response as the cut-off frequency of the excitation is increased is obtained.},

  abstract = {In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two series as a function of the displacement of one relative to the other. This is also known as a sliding dot product or sliding inner-product. It is commonly used for searching a long signal for a shorter, known feature. It has applications in pattern recognition, single particle analysis, electron tomography, averaging, cryptanalysis, and neurophysiology. The cross-correlation is similar in nature to the convolution of two functions.  In an autocorrelation, which is the cross-correlation of a signal with itself, there will always be a peak at a lag of zero, and its size will be the signal energy. In probability and statistics, the term cross-correlations refers to the correlations between the entries of two random vectors                                    X                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{X\} \}    and                                    Y                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{Y\} \}   , while the correlations of a random vector                                    X                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{X\} \}    are the correlations between the entries of                                    X                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{X\} \}    itself, those forming the correlation matrix of                                    X                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbf \{X\} \}   .

  abstract = {An experimental study is performed on the vortex induced vibrations of a rigid flexibly mounted circular cylinder placed in a crossflow. The cylinder is allowed to oscillate in combined crossflow and in-line motions, and the ratio of the nominal in-line and transverse natural frequencies is varied systematically. Experiments were conducted on a smooth cylinder at subcritical Reynolds numbers between 15 000 and 60 000 and on a roughened cylinder at supercritical Reynolds numbers between 320 000 and 710 000, with a surface roughness equal to 0.23 \% of the cylinder diameter. Strong qualitative and quantitative similarities between the subcritical and supercritical experiments are found, especially when the in-line natural frequency is close to twice the value of the crossflow natural frequency. In both Reynolds number regimes, the test cylinder may exhibit a `dual-resonant' response, resulting in resonant crossflow motion at a frequency fv, near the Strouhal frequency, and resonant in-line motion at 2 fv. This dual resonance is shown to occur over a relatively wide frequency region around the Strouhal frequency, accompanied by stable, highly repeatable figure-eight cylinder orbits, as well as large third-harmonic components of the lift force. Under dual-resonance conditions, both the subcritical and the supercritical response is shown to collapse into a narrow parametric region in which the effective natural-frequency ratio is near the value 2, regardless of the nominal natural-frequency ratio. Some differences are noted in the magnitudes of forces and the cylinder response between the two different Reynolds number regimes, but the dual-resonant response and the resulting force trends are preserved despite the large Reynolds number difference.},

Previous studies of this mechanism for vortex-shedding control have largely been confined to two-dimensional flows at low Reynolds number, and to a single ratio of splitter plate width to cylinder diameter. In this study, we consider fully-turbulent, three-dimensional flows at high Reynolds number, and investigate the dependence of vortex-shedding suppression on two geometric parameters; namely the ratio of splitter-plate width and height to cylinder diameter and length. The computations were performed with the OpenFOAM software using a well-validated turbulence closure that considers the effects of the organized mean-flow unsteadiness on the random turbulent fluctuations. Comparisons were made with experimental data, and the validated method is used to perform a systematic study to determine the effectiveness of vortex suppression. To aid in the analysis, two-point correlations of forces along span of cylinder were obtained to determine uncoupling conditions of sectional oscillations. The results obtained indicate that splitter plates provide a practical method for vortex suppression at high Reynolds number, and the degree of suppression can be maximized by optimal geometric configuration.},

  abstract = {According to the Danish wind turbine industry cross-wind vibrations due to wave loading misaligned with wind turbulence often have a significant influence on the fatigue lifespan of offshore wind turbine foundations. The phenomenon is characterised by increasing fatigue loads compared to the fore-aft fatigue and a small amount of system damping since almost no aerodynamic damping from the blades takes place. In addition, modern offshore wind turbines are flexible structures with resonance frequencies close to environmental loads and turbine blades passing the tower. Therefore, in order to avoid conservatism leading to additional costs during the load calculation and the design phase, the structural response must be analysed using reliable estimations of the dynamic properties of the wind turbines. Based on a thorough investigation of ``rotor-stop'' tests performed on offshore wind turbines supported by a monopile foundation for different wind parks in the period 2006\textendash 2011, the paper evaluates the first natural frequency and modal damping of the structures. In addition, fitting of theoretical energy spectra to measured response spectra of operating turbines is presented as an alternative method of determining the system damping. Analyses show distinctly time-dependent crosswind dynamic properties. Based on numerical analysis, the variation is believed to be caused by sediment transportation at seabed level and varying performance of tower oscillation dampers.},

The vortex induced vibration responses and lift forces on the up- and downstream cylinders were studied under different spacing ratios and compared with those on a single cylinder. The results show that the spacing ratio plays an important role in VIV until the ratio reaches 4. For a small spacing ratio, a significant difference between the lift forces on the up- and downstream cylinders appears and induces a large torsional moment. For the convenience of engineering application, a torsional coefficient was proposed. The maximum torsional coefficient can reach 2.9, 1.2 and 0.98 for spacing ratios of 2, 3 and 4 at the reduced velocity of 5, respectively. Considering the vortex induced vibration responses as well as the torsional moment, a spacing ratio of 3 was recommended for tandem floating tunnel design.},

In addition, the potential for building-based solar electricity is assessed. We find that long-term combined potentials range between 730 and 3700EJ/a worldwide, depending crucially on the acceptable share of land\textemdash up to 3.5\% of total (non-ice covered) land on earth. Realistic potentials account for limitations such as land-use competition and acceptance, together with resource quality and remoteness as proxies for cost. Today's electricity demand (65EJ/a) is well covered by the range, but constraints may occur in the long run locally.

  abstract = {An offshore integrated meteorological mast (OIMM) is introduced which has great application potential for the development of offshore wind turbine power. This innovative OIMM features in two aspects: the integrated construction and the integrated transportation. Its integrated techniques enable this OIMM to be prefabricated onshore and transported by a relatively small tugboat to the installation site. It is efficient in construction, rapid in transportation and saving in cost. The towing process is an important section for the integrated transportation, which makes the towing operation necessary to investigate. With the numerical simulation software MOSES, the hydrodynamic behavior of the towing operation is investigated. Two special wet towing methods (surface towing and submerged towing) are adopted and analyzed in terms of the towing resistance, towing speed, fairlead position and the motion response. The results show that for both towing methods, to obtain a higher speed by increasing the towing force is uneconomic since the towing resistance increases a much higher percentage than the towing speed dose. Surface towing has a smaller resistance but larger motion response compared to submerged towing. The submerged towing shows a clear descending heave motion. The heave and pitch motions are smaller with the lower fairlead position and fluctuate less with deeper submerged depth.},

First, the differences between the Kaimal and Mann models are discussed, including the power spectrum and spatial coherence. Next, two types of LiDAR systems are examined to analyze 5 the LiDAR measurement coherence based on commercially available LiDAR scan patterns. Finally, numerical simulations have been performed to compare the LiDAR measurement coherence for different rotor sizes. This work confirms the association between the measurement coherence and the turbulence model. The results indicate that the LiDAR measurement coherence with the Mann turbulence model is lower than that with the Kaimal turbulence model. In other words, the value creation of LAC, evaluated using the Kaimal turbulence model, will be diminished if the Mann turbulence model is used instead. In 10 particular, the difference in coherence is more significant for larger rotors. As a result, this paper suggests that the impacts of different turbulence models should be considered as uncertainties while evaluating the benefits of LAC.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind turbines are influenced not only by environmental loads such as the wind and waves, but also by various harmonic excitations and have always been considered as complex coupled vibration systems under operational conditions. Generally, the proposed excitations and corresponding vibration sources have a direct relationship with the structural operational safety of the offshore wind turbine and can be reflected by the vibration responses. Nevertheless, existing studies in this area mainly focus on understanding the effect of environmental excitations on the structural vibrations of offshore wind turbines and identifying the dynamic parameters. The research on the identification of the vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution of offshore wind turbine structures based on the observation data have not yet been carried out. Therefore, using the measured vibration responses of an offshore wind turbine prototype, an identification technology based on optimized spectral kurtosis (OSK) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) methods, which is capable of determining both the structural vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution was presented for the first time. It can be demonstrated that the structural vibration sources changed from environmental excitations to forced harmonic loads when the rotating speed and power of the turbine increased. At the same time, the main vibration energy underwent a transformation from random vibration energy to harmonic vibration energy with a change in the operational factors. Furthermore, it is suggested that the relationship between the rotating frequency and structural modal frequencies in the structural operational safety assessment of offshore wind turbines should be further investigated.},

Since the water regions selected for building those wind farms have different depths, there was need to study different possible technical variants of this task, with the reference to both the foundation structures themselves, and the technology of their transport and setting, or anchoring.

  abstract = {The reverse vortex street differs from the ordinary Karman vortex street in the direction of the rotation of the vortices. Such a street is formed behind the oscillating airfoils in the flow. It is of interest in connection with studies of the aerodynamics of flapping wings. It is known that the vortex wake behind a symmetric airfoil performing symmetric oscillations in a certain range of parameters becomes asymmetric, which leads to the appearance of a nonzero average lift. Reasons of the symmetry violation are associated with the instability of the reverse vortex street, but the mechanism of this instability is currently not well understood. In this work, the analysis of the stability of the reverse vortex street is carried out on the basis of the theory developed by Karman for infinite rows of point vortices. In contrast to the Karman model, in this work, semi-infinite rows with periodically arising new vortices at their ends are considered. This is the first time this model has been used. It is shown that the periodic appearance of new vortices radically affects the characteristics of the street stability. It is found that the violation of the symmetry of the reverse vortex street is associated with its instability to bending perturbations, while the ordinary Karman vortex street behind the body is unstable to varicose perturbations. Regions of instability are determined.},

Wind energy is one of the renewable energy resources. Considerable wind speed has made settling of wind turbines at sea beneficial and appealing. For this purpose, choosing the appropriate plates to set up wind turbines on the surface of sea is necessary. Regarding the installation condition, by choosing suitable geometry for floating breakwaters, offshore wind turbine can be mounted on them. Suitable geometry of breakwater for multifunctional usage could be selected with analyzing and comparing pressure, force and moment produced by incoming waves. In this article, the boundary element method is implemented to solve governing differential equations by assuming potential flow. On the other hand, for promoting free surface in each time step, the EulerLagrangian method is employed. Finally, to find the appropriate geometry for installing the wind turbine on the breakwater, moment and wave profile next to the right and left side of breakwater body are calculated. Among simulated geometries, breakwater with trapezoid geometry which its larger base is placed in the water has more sustainability and it is the most suitable geometry for wind turbine installation.},

  abstract = {Condition monitoring (CM) of wind turbine blades has significant benefits for wind farm operators and insurers alike. Blades present a particular challenge in terms of operations and maintenance: the wide range of materials used in their construction makes it difficult to predict lifetimes; loading is stochastic and highly variable; and access can be problematic due to the remote locations where turbines are frequently located, particularly for offshore installations. Whilst previous works have indicated that Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers are viable devices for measuring the vibrations from which diagnostic information can be derived, thus far there has been no analysis of how such a system would be powered. This paper considers the power requirement of a self-powered blade-tip autonomous system and how those requirements can be met. The radio link budget is derived for the system and the average power requirement assessed. Following this, energy harvesting methods such as photovoltaics, vibration, thermal and radio frequency (RF) are explored. Energy storage techniques and energy regulation for the autonomous system are assessed along with their relative merits. It is concluded that vibration (piezoelectric) energy harvesting combined with lithium-ion batteries are suitable selections for such a system. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To obtain different responses of the coupled flow\textendash structure system we vary the structure's bending stiffness to model the behaviour of a vibrating inflexible (rigid) cylinder, a cable, and a beam. We have found that unlike the laminar flow previously studied, the amplitude of the cross-flow oscillation is about one diameter for the cable and the beam, close to experimental measurements, but is lower for the rigid cylinder. We have also found that for the latter case the flow response corresponds to parallel shedding, but for the beam and cable with free endpoints a mixed response consisting of oblique and parallel shedding is obtained, caused by the modulated travelling wave motion of the structure. This mixed shedding pattern which alternates periodically along the span can be directly related to periodic spatial variation of the lift force. In the case of structures with pinned endpoints a standing wave response is obtained for the cylinder; lace-like flow structures are observed similar to the ones seen in the laminar regime. Examination of the frequency spectra in the near wake shows that at Re = 1000 all cases follow a -5/3 law in the inertial range, which extends about half a decade in wavenumber. However, these spectra are different in all three cases both in low and high frequencies, with the exception of the beam and cable, for which the high-frequency portion is identical despite the differences in the displacement time history and the large-scale features of the corresponding flow.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the pattern of wind turbine tower collapse as a result of the coupled effects of wind and an intense, near-field earthquake is investigated. The constitutive relation of the tower cylinder steel is simulated via a nonlinear kinematic hardening model, and the specific value of each parameter in the constitutive model is provided. A precise model of the tower structure coupled with the blade is created using a nonlinear, finite element method. This method is compared with the results from a static pushover test of a small cylindrical tower to validate the finite element modeling method in this research. Two earthquake wave sets are selected as inputs. One contains 20 near-field velocity pulse-like ground motion waves with various pulse periods; the other contains 20 ordinary far-field ground motion waves. A wind turbine tower with a hub height of 60 m is selected as an example for analysis. The dynamic response of this tower as a result of the coupled effects of the two ground motion wave sets and a transient wind load is calculated using nonlinear time-history analysis. The calculation results shows that the average horizontal displacement of the tower top as a result of the near-field velocity pulse-like ground motion is 33\% larger than the case with far-field ground motion. Finally, the seismic collapse vulnerability curve of this wind turbine tower is calculated. The seismic collapse capacity of the tower is evaluated, and the seismic collapse pattern of the tower is analyzed.},

  abstract = {Wind turbine towers are continuously subjected to wind force as their major dynamic load. Dynamic response of the wind turbine tower subjected to wind forces is usually estimated by numerical methods such as finite element method (FEM). In this paper, the analytical transfer matrix method (TMM) is used to determine wind load response of wind turbine. Therefore, various and general models including coupled springs (CS), distributed springs (DS) and apparent fixity length (AF) models are employed for modeling of wind turbine foundation and axial force is modeled as a variable force along the tower, as well. Wind force is divided into two parts containing thrust and distributed force. The transfer matrix is derived based on Euler-Bernoulli's beam differential equation. The global transfer matrix is obtained by applying boundary conditions of the tower and constructing the point matrix. Then, the factors affecting the tower dynamic response such as foundation models, axial induction factor, terrain factor, wind shear and gust condition are examined in several case studies. Finally, the TMM results are compared with the available results in the literature such as of the FEM which show good agreement. The comparisons can be concluded that the TMM can be used instead of the conventional numerical methods maintaining high accuracy for wind induced vibration analysis of wind turbine towers.},

The impulse response (that is, the output in response to a Kronecker delta input) of an Nth-order discrete-time FIR filter lasts exactly N + 1 samples (from first nonzero element through last nonzero element) before it then settles to zero.

  abstract = {The presented investigations aim to suggest more realistic models to predict the dynamic behavior of wind turbine structures. Two key issues are addressed: the aerodynamic damping and the cross-wind vibrations. Based on experimental studies in the boundary layer wind tunnel, aerodynamic information for both effects has been obtained. A scaled model of a wind energy tower (1:150) in combination with complementary models have been tested in a test bench designed to carry out HFFB, dynamic wind pressure and forced-oscillation experiments. Reynolds number based scale effects on the tower model have been studied previously. In the predictions of cross-wind vibrations, the length related correlation of vortices shedding from cylindrical structures plays an important role. Therefore, wind dynamic pressures were measured along static tower and cylinder models using pressure taps to determine realistic values of the vortex shedding correlation length. Motion-induced wind vibrations can be significantly influenced by the aerodynamic damping. Using the forced-oscillations method, experiments have been performed under controlled system oscillation with varying wind speed in prism models and tower model. The measured base model forces were correlated with the model motion using spectral methods to obtain the corresponding aerodynamic stiffness and damping coefficients. Both aerodynamic studies will allow more detailed models for the design of new wind tower structures. The acquired information will be applicable in MB-simulations to obtain more realistic and accurate wind turbine performances},

Similar impacts will be associated with the eventual removal of offshore wind turbines. We conducted a global survey of environmental experts to guide best decommissioning practices in the North Sea, a region with a substantial removal burden. In contrast to current regulations, 94.7\% of experts (36 out of 38) agreed that a more flexible case-by-case approach to decommissioning could benefit the North Sea environment. Partial removal options were considered to deliver better environmental outcomes than complete removal for platforms, but both approaches were equally supported for wind turbines. Key considerations identified for decommissioning were biodiversity enhancement, provision of reef habitat, and protection from bottom trawling, all of which are negatively affected by complete removal. We provide recommendations to guide the revision of offshore decommissioning policy, including a temporary suspension of obligatory removal.},

  abstract = {One of the biggest cost drivers during the installation of offshore wind turbines is the single blade assembly, which could be reduced by using a mass damper. Especially relevant advantages that increase lucrativeness are: shorter assembly times, reduced waiting times between the single blade installations and operations under comparably higher waves. Based on measurements taken during the installation of an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, it was possible to compare the installation times before and after the use of a mass damper. Based on that, a cost model for the single blade installation was created. The results of the analysis shows a cost reduction of up to 30 percent. Another significant point is the reduction of the standard deviation of the installation times. However, the small number of measurements taken represent challenges regarding accuracy. The results of the analysis indicate that the use of a mass damper leads to a much more efficient installation, which makes the use of offshore wind turbines notably more profitable.},

We explore the response of the filament for a wide range of flexibility and inertia. Lock-in with a large number of normal modes of the filament, each in a different regime of reduced speed, is observed. Reduced speed is the free-stream speed of the incoming flow non-dimensionalized with the first natural frequency of the structure and the diameter of the cylinder. Several branches, based on response of the filament, are identified and the contributions of various structural modes along these branches are quantified. Contribution from a particular structural mode increases significantly during lock-in, accompanied by a large amplitude of vibration. The transition between different branches is found to be hysteretic and intermittent. The flow exhibits a variety of vortex-shedding patterns, including the                                                                      \$\textbackslash mathsf \{2P+2S\}\$                                               mode.

The transformation of wake from one mode of shedding to another is explained phenomenologically. Variation of rate of energy transfer between the fluid and filament with space and time is analysed to determine optimal placement of transducers for harvesting energy.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a summary of the recent work at NTNU on the installation of offshore wind turbines using jack-up and floating vessels will be reported. The wind turbine components considered here are the monopile foundations and the blades. The detailed discussions are given to the crane operations for installing wind turbine blades as well as novel installation methods for pre-assembled rotor-nacelle-tower. It includes numerical modelling and analysis for global dynamic responses of the installation system (installation vessels plus wind turbines) and for local structural responses of the blades in case of contact/impact. In particular, the stochastic nature of the environmental conditions (mainly wind and waves) and their influence on the global dynamic responses of the installation system will be assessed based on time-domain simulations. In addition, tugger line tension control is introduced for the final connection to the hub in order to reduce the motions of the blade and therefore the potential damages to the blades. It is then followed by a discussion about nonlinear structural analysis of the blade in contact with tower or surrounding structures using ABAQUS. Damages in the composite plies and sandwich core materials of the blade due to contact/impact for a given initial velocity are then estimated. The obtained damage distribution formulates the basis for a probabilistic assessment of structural safety during installation. Novel installation methods in which the rotor-nacelle-tower structure is pre-assembled onshore and installed on top of the foundation offshore, and the corresponding installation vessels are discussed at the end of the paper. Finally, the main conclusions and the recommendations for future work are drawn.},

  abstract = {The crossflow principle is one of the key elements used in engineering models for prediction of the aerodynamic loads on wind turbine blades in standstill or blade installation situations, where the flow direction relative to the wind turbine blade has a component in the direction of the blade span direction. In the present work, the performance of the crossflow principle is assessed on the DTU 10MW reference blade using extensive 3D CFD calculations. Analysis of the computational results shows that there is only a relatively narrow region in which the crossflow principle describes the aerodynamic loading well. In some conditions the deviation of the predicted loadings can be quite significant, having a large influence on for instance the integral aerodynamic moments around the blade centre of mass; which is very important for single blade installation applications. The main features of these deviations, however, have a systematic behaviour on all force components, which in this paper is employed to formulate the first version of an engineering correction method to the crossflow principle applicable for wind turbine blades. The new correction model improves the agreement with CFD results for the key aerodynamic loads in crossflow situations. The general validity of this model for other blade shapes should be investigated in subsequent works.},

This work characterizes the first-order aerodynamic and aeroelastic behavior of a single blade installation system, where the blade is grabbed by a yoke, which is lifted by the crane and stabilized by two taglines. A simple engineering model is formulated to describe the aerodynamic forcing on the blade subject to turbulent wind of arbitrary direction. The model is coupled with a schematic aeroelastic representation of the taglines system, which returns the minimum line tension required to compensate for the aerodynamic forcing. The simplified models are in excellent agreement with the aeroelastic code HAWC2, and provide a solid basis for future design of an upgraded single blade installation system able to operate at higher wind speeds.},

The modification of the cylinder with soft, flexible flaps made of silicone rubber has been shown to affect the vortex shedding cycle in a way that the Strouhal number associated with the vortex shedding suddenly jumps to a higher value at a certain Reynolds number. In the present study, the effect of the flexible flaps on the vortex shedding is further examined by subsequently reducing the number of flaps and additionally shortening their length. Acoustic measurements and camera recordings of the flap motion, performed in an aeroacoustic wind tunnel, suggest that the sudden jump of the Reynolds number is caused by the movement of the outer flaps. A comparison with the eigenfrequencies obtained from a numerical modal analysis of the different flap rings revealed that the cause of the Strouhal number jump is most likely a lock-in of the natural vortex shedding cycle with the next higher eigenfrequency of the outer flaps.},

Focusing on a baseline 5-MW turbine mounted on a monopile, equipped with an omnidirectional tuned mass damper inside the nacelle, the study explores a wide range of potential tuning frequencies, mass and damping ratios, in both operational and parked rotor conditions. It is found that the tuning frequency to attain optimal reduction of structural vibrations shall be changed depending on the wind velocity in operational conditions while, in contrast, is generally equal to the natural frequency of the first support structure modes only in parked conditions. This result, attributable to inherent non-linearity of rotor dynamics, demonstrates that a conventional design of the tuned mass damper based on the natural frequencies of the support structure modes may not be suitable for offshore wind turbines.},

  abstract = {The offshore wind industry is building and planning new wind farms further offshore due to increasing demand on sustainable energy production and already occupied prime resource locations closer to shore. Costs of operation and maintenance, transport and installation of offshore wind turbines already contribute significantly to the cost of produced electricity and will continue to increase, due to moving further offshore, if the current techniques of predicting offshore wind farm accessibility are to stay the same. The majority of offshore operations are carried out by specialized ships that must be hired for the duration of the operation. Therefore, offshore wind farm accessibility and costs of offshore activities are primarily driven by the expected number of operational hours offshore and waiting times for weather windows, suitable for offshore operations. Having more reliable weather window estimates would result in better wind farm accessibility predictions and, as a consequence, potentially reduce the cost of offshore wind energy. This paper presents an updated methodology of weather window prediction that uses physical offshore vessel and equipment responses to establish the expected probabilities of operation failure, which, in turn, can be compared to maximum allowable probability of failure to obtain weather windows suitable for operation. Two case studies were performed to evaluate the feasibility of the improved methodology, and the results indicated that it produced consistent and improved results. In fact, the updated methodology predicts 57\% and 47\% more operational hours during the test period when compared to standard alpha-factor and the original methodologies.},

  abstract = {Costs of operation \& maintenance, assembly, transport and installation of offshore wind turbines contribute significantly to the total cost of offshore wind farm. These operations are mostly carried out by specific ships that have to be hired for the operational phase and for duration of installation process, respectively. Duration, and therefore ship hiring costs is, among others, driven by waiting time for weather windows for weather-sensitive operations. Today, state of the art decision making criteria for weather-sensitive operations are restrictions to the significant wave height and the average wind velocity at reference height. However, actual limitations are physical, related to response of equipment used e.g. crane wire tension, rotor assembly motions while lifting, etc. Transition from weather condition limits to limits on physical equipment response in decision making would improve weather window predictions, potentially reducing cost of offshore wind energy. This paper presents a novel approach to weather window estimation using ensemble weather forecasts and statistical analysis of simulated installation equipment response. (C) 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Steel monopiles are support structures mostly applied for offshore wind turbines. Their installation is straightforward, in particular, in shallow and medium waters. While the wind turbine tower is primarily affected by wind, the wave loads are dominant for the monopile, as it is submerged to a large extent. This study deals with the influence of uncertainties in material and load parameters on the behaviour of those structures. It is investigated how the scattering of material properties (namely Young's modulus of elasticity) affect the structural response. In addition, loads with different characteristics are applied, and it is examined how the changes in loads influence the structural response. The analysed output data of interest are the extreme stresses leading to accumulation of fatigue damage. In order for a realistic modelling, wave loads are considered with irregular sea states with different wave characteristics (significant wave heights and wave peak periods). The final aim of the analysis is to classify the effects of specific wave characteristics on the stresses by means of a sensitivity analysis. The analysis shows that variations in the wave peak period have the strongest influence on stress outputs. This effect results from the strong sensitivity of the structural dynamical response to decrease of the difference between the values of the wave peak frequency and the natural frequencies of the structure.

Some investigations on such a problem are carried out in order to have a better understanding of the physics involved in vortex-induced motions of floating bodies such as offshore platforms. In this paper, experiments were carried out in a recirculating water channel over the range of Reynolds number 6000 {$<$} Re {$<$}70 000. Measured response amplitudes and frequencies of cylinders with two degrees of freedom, three different small mass ratios (m*= 1.00; 2.62 and 4.36) and very low aspect ratios (0.3 {$<$}= L/D {$<$}= 2.0) were shown and the results were discussed in depth. Conversely to what would be expected for cylinders with very low aspect ratio, the results showed large motions in the transverse direction with maximum amplitudes around 1.5 diameters for cylinders with L/D= 2.0, despite being smaller when the aspect ratio is reduced. Moreover, the response amplitudes presented high values around 0.4 diameters in the in-line direction. In fact, the large transverse motions were related to a strong coupling with the in-line responses, visibly identified in the plots of nondimensional frequency, as well as by the trajectories in the XY-plane, Lissajous figures, particularly in the case of m*=1.00 and L/D = 2.0, when 8-shape trajectories were clearly observed. The case of m*= 1.00 deserves more attention because of its smaller amplitude compared to the cases with the same aspect ratio and a larger mass ratio. This counter-intuitive behavior seems to be related to the energy transferring process from the steady stream to the oscillatory hydroelastic system. Finally, it is noteworthy that the characteristic of the "Strouhal-like" number decreases when the aspect ratio decreases, as also observed in previous works available in the literature, most of them for stationary cylinders.

We employ a technique to accurately control the structural damping, enabling the system to take on both negative and positive damping.

For a given \textbackslash textit\{Re\}\textbackslash mbox\{\textbackslash textit\{Re\}\}, the amplitude A{${_\ast}$}A\^* appears to be proportional to a function of mass\textendash damping, A{${_\ast}\propto$}g({$\alpha$})A\^*\textbackslash propto g(\textbackslash alpha), which is a similar function over all \textbackslash textit\{Re\}\textbackslash mbox\{\textbackslash textit\{Re\}\}. A good best-fit for a wide range of mass\textendash damping and Reynolds number is thus given by the following simple expression, where A{${_\ast}$}=g({$\alpha$})f(\textbackslash textit\{Re\})A\^*\textbackslash,\{=\}\textbackslash, g(\textbackslash alpha)\textbackslash,f(\textbackslash mbox\{\textbackslash textit\{Re\}\}): A{${_\ast}$}=(1-1.12{$\alpha$}+0.30{$\alpha$}2)log⁡(0.41\textbackslash textit\{Re\}0.36). A\^* \textbackslash,\{=\}\textbackslash,(1 - 1.12\textbackslash,\textbackslash alpha + 0.30\textbackslash,\textbackslash alpha\^2)\textbackslash,\textbackslash log (0.41\textbackslash,\textbackslash mbox\{\textbackslash textit\{Re\}\}\^\{0.36\}).  In essence, by using a renormalized parameter, which we define as the `modified amplitude', AM{${_\ast}$}=A{${_\ast}$}/A{$\alpha$}=0{${_\ast}$}A\^*\_M\textbackslash,\{=\}\textbackslash,A\^*/A\^*\_\{\textbackslash alpha\{=\}0\}, the previously scattered data collapse very well onto a single curve, g({$\alpha$})g(\textbackslash alpha), on what we refer to as the `modified Griffin plot'. There has also been much debate over the last three decades concerning the validity of using the product of mass and damping (such as {$\alpha\backslash$}alpha) in these problems. Our results indicate that the combined mass\textendash damping parameter ({$\alpha\backslash$}alpha) does indeed collapse peak-amplitude data well, at a given \textbackslash textit\{Re\}\textbackslash mbox\{\textbackslash textit\{Re\}\}, independent of the precise mass and damping values, for mass ratios down to m{${_\ast}$}=1m\^*\textbackslash,\{=\}\textbackslash,1.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the transverse vortex-induced vibrations of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder in a fluid flow. We use simultaneous force, displacement and vorticity measurements (using DPIV) for the first time in free vibrations. There exist two distinct types of response in such systems, depending on whether one has a high or low combined mass\textendash damping parameter (m*{$\zeta$}). In the classical high-(m*{$\zeta$}) case, an `initial' and `lower' amplitude branch are separated by a discontinuous mode transition, whereas in the case of low (m*{$\zeta$}), a further higher-amplitude `upper' branch of response appears, and there exist two mode transitions.To understand the existence of more than one mode transition for low (m*{$\zeta$}), we employ two distinct formulations of the equation of motion, one of which uses the `total force', while the other uses the `vortex force', which is related only to the dynamics of vorticity. The first mode transition involves a jump in `vortex phase' (between vortex force and displacement), {$\phi$}vortex, at which point the frequency of oscillation (f) passes through the natural frequency of the system in the fluid, f {$\sim$} fNwater. This transition is associated with a jump between 2S [harr ] 2P vortex wake modes, and a corresponding switch in vortex shedding timing. Across the second mode transition, there is a jump in `total phase', phis;total , at which point f {$\sim$} fNvacuum. In this case, there is no jump in {$\phi$}vortex, since both branches are associated with the 2P mode, and there is therefore no switch in timing of shedding, contrary to previous assumptions. Interestingly, for the high-(m*{$\zeta$}) case, the vibration frequency jumps across both fNwater and fNvacuum, corresponding to the simultaneous jumps in {$\phi$}vortex and {$\phi$}total. This causes a switch in the timing of shedding, coincident with the `total phase' jump, in agreement with previous assumptions.For large mass ratios, m* = O(100), the vibration frequency for synchronization lies close to the natural frequency (f* = f/fN {$\approx$} 1.0), but as mass is reduced to m* = O(1), f* can reach remarkably large values. We deduce an expression for the frequency of the lower-branch vibration, as follows:formula herewhich agrees very well with a wide set of experimental data. This frequency equation uncovers the existence of a critical mass ratio, where the frequency f* becomes large: m*crit = 0.54. When m* {$<$} m*crit, the lower branch can never be reached and it ceases to exist. The upper-branch large-amplitude vibrations persist for all velocities, no matter how high, and the frequency increases indefinitely with flow velocity. Experiments at m* {$<$} m*crit show that the upper-branch vibrations continue to the limits (in flow speed) of our facility.},

To date, repair activities are often conducted using huge jack-up crane vessels and by applying a reverse installation procedure. Because of the high costs associated with installation and removal of offshore wind turbine components and the low profit margin of the offshore wind industry, alternative methods for installation and removal are needed. This paper introduces a novel concept for replacement or installation of offshore wind turbine blades. The concept involves a medium-sized jack-up crane vessel and a tower climbing mechanism. This mechanism provides a stable platform for clamping, lowering, and lifting of a blade. A case study of a 5-MW offshore wind turbine is shown, where common engineering practices were applied and numerical simulations of the marine operations were carried out using finite element and multibody simulation tools. Operational limits for wave and wind actions were established to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed concept.},

  abstract = {Installation of Offshore Wind Turbine structural components need to be executed in sea states for which their dynamic responses are expected to remain within a safe domain or perform a limited number of outcrossings from the safe boundary beyond which the responses may lead to unsafe working conditions, large impact loads or even structural failure. A critical installation activity limiting the installation of a Transition Piece T P is often the motion monitoring phase of the mating points until its landing on the foundation. The operational limit is normally given by the horizontal displacement and the safe domain could conveniently be defined by a circle of radius r in the horizontal plane. This paper presents an existing general accurate method and its solution to estimate the outcrossing rate of dynamic responses for a circular safe boundary in short crested seas which is applicable for the motion monitoring phase of offshore wind turbine components prior to mating. The required input is calculated from spectral analysis in the frequency domain and the solution is derived for Gaussian processes. It is found that both 1st and 2nd order responses have to be included and that the Gaussian assumption for the slow drift motions is not valid so that its real PDF is required. Also wave spreading has large influence in the outcrossing rate and should realistically be applied. The suggested approach is in agreement with real offshore practice, and is efficient when compared with time domain simulations. Then, the outcrossing rate method could help on Marine Operations decision making during critical installation activities.},

In the proposed methodology, the operational limits are established in terms of allowable limits of sea states. In addition, the operational limits of a complete marine operation are determined by taking into account several activities, their durations, continuity, and sequential execution. This methodology is demonstrated in a case study dealing with installation of an offshore wind turbine monopile (MP) and a transition piece (TP).

  abstract = {Current installation costs of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are high and profit margins in the offshore wind energy sector are low, it is thus necessary to develop installation methods that are more efficient and practical. This paper presents a numerical study (based on a global response analysis of marine operations) of a novel procedure for installing the tower and Rotor Nacelle Assemblies (RNAs) on bottom-fixed foundations of OWTs. The installation procedure is based on the inverted pendulum principle. A cargo barge is used to transport the OWT assembly in a horizontal position to the site, and a medium-size Heavy Lift Vessel (HLV) is then employed to lift and up-end the OWT assembly using a special upending frame. The main advantage of this novel procedure is that the need for a huge HLV (in terms of lifting height and capacity) is eliminated. This novel method requires that the cargo barge is in the leeward side of the HLV (which can be positioned with the best heading) during the entire installation. This is to benefit from shielding effects of the HLV on the motions of the cargo barge, so the foundations need to be installed with a specific heading based on wave direction statistics of the site and a typical installation season. Following a systematic approach based on numerical simulations of actual operations, potential critical installation activities, corresponding critical events, and limiting (response) parameters are identified. In addition, operational limits for some of the limiting parameters are established in terms of allowable limits of sea states. Following a preliminary assessment of these operational limits, the duration of the entire operation, the equipment used, and weather- and water depth-sensitivity, this novel procedure is demonstrated to be viable.},

  abstract = {In the design process of marine structures such as offshore wind turbines the long-term distribution of significant wave height needs to be modelled to estimate loads. This is typically done by fitting a translated Weibull distribution to measured or simulated wave data. However, the translated Weibull distribution often fits well at typical values, but poorly at high wave heights such that extreme loads are underestimated. Here, we analyzed wave datasets from six locations suitable for offshore wind turbines at the US east coast and at the North Sea. We found that the exponentiated Weibull distribution provides better overall fit to these wave data than the translated Weibull distribution. However, when the translated Weibull distribution was fitted using maximum likelihood estimation, model fit at the upper tail is sometimes still poor. Thus, to ensure good model fit at the tail, we estimated the distributions' parameters by prioritizing observations of high wave height using weighted least squares estimation. Then, these distributions fit well at the bulks of the datasets (mean absolute error in the order of 0.1 m) and at the upper tails (mean absolute error in the order of 0.5 m). Based on these results, we propose that \textendash{} if data do not indicate otherwise \textendash{} the exponetiated Weibull distribution should be fitted to wave data instead of the translated Weibull distribution.},

This work compares the extreme response along the 50-year environmental contour withthe true 50-year wind turbine response. It was found that the environmental contour method that is currentlydescribed in the IEC design standard for offshore wind turbines can strongly under-predict the 50-year returnvalue of response variables whose annual maxima typically occur during power production.  The bias in thecontour-based estimate of the 50-year response can be attributed to three sources:  (1) the method used toconstruct the contour; (2) neglecting serial correlation in environmental conditions; and (3) neglecting theshort-term variability in the response.  In our analysis the 50-year maximum mudline overturning momentwas underestimated by 4-8\% by the contour-based approach that is currently recommended, whereas thebending moment at 10 m water depth was underestimated by 25-28\%.  This underestimation was mainlydue to ignoring the short-term variability in the response.  The bias associated with contour construction,an effect much discussed in recent publications, was of much smaller magnitude.

Because turbines are placed at sea-out of sight, out of mind-they are expected to avoid the public resistance experienced with respect to onshore installations. This paper examines offshore wind scientists' constructions of the public(s) by identifying narratives in the research communities. It is based on twenty-six semistructured interviews with scientists at two national research centres on offshore wind energy and technology in Norway. It finds that, although the dominant narrative of these scientists conveys a positive public, expectations of public resistance and constructions of public sentiment as NIMBY ('not in my backyard') are present in the research environments. This continued presence of narratives of irrational public resistance in the scientists' imaginings could be understood as an act of othering the public, with the possible implication of a disembedded technology development. The paper concludes by asking whether the persistence of constructions of resistant publics mirrors a pessimistic engineering mindset.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a newly developed high-fidelity fluid\textendash structure interaction simulation tool for geometrically resolved rotor simulations of wind turbines. The tool consists of a partitioned coupling between the structural part of the aero-elastic solver HAWC2 and the finite volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver EllipSys3D. The paper shows that the implemented loose coupling scheme, despite a non-conservative force transfer, maintains a sufficient numerical stability and a second-order time accuracy. The use of a strong coupling is found to be redundant. In a first test case, the newly developed coupling between HAWC2 and EllipSys3D (HAWC2CFD) is utilized to compute the aero-elastic response of the NREL 5-MW reference wind turbine (RWT) under normal operational conditions. A comparison with the low-fidelity but state-of-the-art aero-elastic solver HAWC2 reveals a very good agreement between the two approaches. In a second test case, the response of the NREL 5-MW RWT is computed during a yawed and thus asymmetric inflow. The continuous good agreement confirms the qualities of HAWC2CFD but also illustrates the strengths of a computationally cheaper blade element momentum theory (BEM) based solver, as long as the solver is applied within the boundaries of the employed engineering models. Two further test cases encompass flow situations, which are expected to exceed the limits of the BEM model. However, the simulation of the NREL 5-MW RWT during an emergency shut down situation still shows good agreements in the predicted structural responses of HAWC2 and HAWC2CFD since the differences in the computed force signals only persist for an insignificantly short time span. The considerable new capabilities of HAWC2CFD are finally demonstrated by simulating vortex-induced vibrations on the DTU 10-MW wind turbine blade in standstill.

  abstract = {This article investigates the aero-elastic response of the DTU 10-MW RWT blade in deep stall conditions with angles of attack in the vicinity of 90 degrees. The simulations were conducted with the high-fidelity fluid\textendash structure interaction simulation tool HAWC2CFD employing the multi-body-based structural model of HAWC2 and the incompressible computational fluid dynamics solver EllipSys3D. The study utilizes detached eddy simulation computations and considers the three-dimensional blade geometry including blade twist and taper. A preliminary frequency analysis of the load variations on a stiff blade showed that an inclined inflow with a velocity component along the blade axis can trigger a spanwise correlated vortex shedding over large parts of the blade. Moderate wind speeds were sufficient to generate vortex shedding with frequencies close to the first edgewise eigenfrequency of the blade. Aero-elastic computations of the elastic blade confirmed the findings of the frequency analysis. Inflow conditions with inclination angles between {$\Psi$} = 20\textdegree{} and {$\Psi$} = 55\textdegree{} and relatively low to moderate wind speeds between V = 16 and V = 26ms-1 were sufficient to trigger severe edgewise blade vibrations with blade tip amplitudes of several metres. The investigated inflow conditions are considered realistic and might occur when the wind turbine is idling or standing still and the yaw system is unable to align the wind turbine with the incoming wind.

The equations for wind buffeting are statistically linearized and m\textasciitilde ke use of spatially averaged turbulence. A numerically generated, continuous field of non-homogeneous turbulence is used as the stochastic input. Typical stochastic properties, such as the turbulence-induced smoothing of mean force coefficients, the non-stationary energy decay of buffeting action in the inertial subrange of turbulence, and the cross-correlations due to the non-homogeneity of the wind, are retained. The action of signature turbulence is limited Io the consideration of regular eddy-shedding, for which the typical broad-banded response of vortex excitation is generated by a pseudo-harmonicai force model with a stochastic frequency-modulation. The force models have mathematically equivalent representations in time and frequency domains. All elements of the force model are verified comparing simulated and measured force responses of slender and line-like bodies.},

  abstract = {Forces are measured at both ends of rigid cylinders with span 60 cm, performing transverse oscillations within an oncoming stream of water, at Reynolds number Re{$\approx$}3800. Forced harmonic motions and free vibrations of uniform and tapered cylinders are studied. To study free motions, a novel force-feedback control system has been developed, consisting of: (a) a force transducer, which measures forces on a section of a cylinder moving forward at constant speed; (b) a computer using the measured force signal to drive in real time a numerical simulation of an equivalent mass-dashpot-spring system; (c) a servomotor and linear table which impose, also in real time, the numerically calculated motion on the cylinder section. The apparatus allows very low equivalent system damping and strict control of the parametric values and structure of the equivalent system.Calculation of the cross-correlation coefficient between forces at the two ends of the uniform cylinder reveals five distinct regimes as a function of the nominal reduced velocity Vrn: two regimes, for low and high values of Vrn, and far away from the value of VrS corresponding to the Strouhal frequency, show small correlation; two regimes immediately adjacent to, but excluding, VrS show strong correlation, close to 1; surprisingly, there is a regime containing the Strouhal frequency, within which correlation is low. Free vibrations with a 40[ratio ]1 tapered cylinder show that the regime of low correlation, containing the Strouhal frequency, stretches to higher reduced velocities, while lock-in starts at lower reduced velocities.When comparing the amplitude and phase of the lift coefficient measured for free and then for forced vibrations, we obtain close agreement, both for tapered and uniform cylinders. When comparing the cross-correlation coefficient, however, we find that it is much higher in the forced oscillations, especially for the uniform cylinder. Hence, although the force magnitude and phase may be replicated well in forced vibrations, the correlation data suggest that differences exist between free and forced vibration cases.},

Offshore wind farms have different topological structures of the collection system, such as AC parallel type, DC parallel type, DC series type, single-ring type, and double-ring type. The purpose of this paper is to analyse reliability and economy for various topologies and provide an insight into wind farm construction. In this study, the topology structure of various offshore wind farms is introduced firstly. Then, the reliability assessment methods are proposed. The reliability of the chain wind farm is analysed with the reliability block diagrams, while the reliability of the ring wind farm is analysed by using the classification method. In addition, the economy is evaluated considering investment costs. The investment cost for each type of component is calculated separately, which contributes to assessing the investment cost of the whole offshore wind farm. Detailed results from a case study, which includes 96 wind turbines, demonstrate that the DC series-parallel wind farm has superiority in reliability and economy, as well as in terms of its potential applications.},

Various loading states involving wind-wave, wind-current, wave-current, wind-wavecurrent to measure the displacement, velocity and acceleration of the tower model at three points on the tower wall respectively. A statistical analysis of the dynamic displacements of the model is conducted to study the effect of various loading states on the respective dynamic response. As outcome of the present study it was confirmed that the current field strongly affects the dynamic response of offshore monopoles and in particular, more significantly than the wave field.

Only the lower 40\% of its length was exposed to the water current in the flume and applied top tensions varied from 15 to 110N giving fundamental natural frequencies in the range from 3.0 to 7.1Hz. Reduced velocities based on the fundamental natural frequency up to 16 were reached. The mass ratio was 1.8 and the combined mass\textendash damping parameter about 0.05. Cross-flow and in-line amplitudes, x\textendash y trajectories and phase synchronisation, dominant frequencies and modal amplitudes are reported. Cross-flow amplitudes up to 0.7 diameters and in-line amplitudes over 0.2 were observed with dominant frequencies given by a Strouhal number of 0.16.},

Furthermore, wind farm (WF) projects are now moving into complex utility scale power generation systems comprising of arrays of large wind turbines (WTs), whose development, installation and operation are constrained by extreme and hostile environments. However, this increases the need for through-life engineering service (TES) for WTs especially in offshore applications, where the operations and maintenance (O\&M) becomes more complicated as a result of the harsh marine weather and environmental conditions. In this paper, TES of WTs is presented - identifying the current state-of-the-art in methods and applications, requirements and needs, challenges, and opportunities of TES in the wind sector. Also an illustrative case study on WT gearbox through-life support is presented to demonstrate the potential opportunities and applications of TES in the wind industry. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Understanding the impact of different deployment factors on the overall cost of wind farms is pertinent toward benchmarking the potential of different investment decision alternatives. In this article, a set of parametric expressions for capital expenditure, operational expenditure, and levelized cost of energy are developed as a function of wind turbine capacity ( ), water depth (WD), distance from port (D), and wind farm capacity ( ). These expressions have been developed through a series of simulations based on a fully integrated, tested cost model which are then generalized through the application of appropriate nonlinear regression equations for a typical offshore wind farm investment and taking into account most current published cost figures. The effectiveness of the models are countersigned through a series of cases, estimating the predicted values with a maximum error of 3.3\%. These expressions will be particularly useful for the preliminary assessment of available deployment sites, offering cost estimates based on global decision variables.},

Firstly, the modal damping ratios and modal frequencies for the first and second modes of a gravity foundation\textendash supported offshore wind turbine are studied. An offshore wind turbine supported by a monopile foundation is then investigated to clarify the characteristics of modal damping ratios and modal frequencies for the monopile foundation. The soil parameters are identified by means of genetic algorithm (GA). Predicted modal damping ratios and modal frequencies as well as modal shapes show good agreement with the field measurements for both foundations. Finally, a sensitivity analysis study is carried out to investigate the effects of soil properties and foundation types on modal damping ratios. For the gravity foundation\textendash supported offshore wind turbine, soil properties affect the modal damping ratio of the second mode largely, but affect that of the first mode little, while for the monopile-supported offshore wind turbine, soil properties affect the modal damping ratios of the first and second modes significantly. Predicted natural periods and modal damping ratios of the first mode for both foundations by a pair of simple models agree well with those by numerical models.},

The present paper utilizes a three-dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3d-PTMD) to mitigate the bidirectional vibrations as well as harvest the kinetic energy using a linear electromagnetic energy harvester. The proposed energy harvester consists of magnets and coil assemblies which are connected with the pendulum to convert the kinetic energy of the pendulum into electricity. An analytical model of the offshore wind turbine coupled with the 3d-PTMD is established using Euler-Lagrangian equation. The mathematical model of the linear electromagnetic energy harvester is established and integrated with the wind turbine model. The optimum design of the electromagnetic energy harvester to minimize the nacelle displacement RMS as well as to maximize the energy output is determined via a numerical search method. The NREL 5 MW baseline wind turbine model is utilized to evaluate the performance of the 3d-PTMD and the energy harvester. Results show that the 3d-PTMD can reduce the bi-directional vibrations induced by misaligned wind and wave loadings. Additionally, electrical energy in orders of magnitude of kilowatts can be harnessed via using the energy harvester.},

  abstract = {The majority of studies on vortex-induced vibrations of a flexibly-mounted rigid cylinder are for the cases where the flow direction is perpendicular to the long axis of the structure. However, in many engineering applications, such as cable stays in bridges and mooring lines of floating offshore wind turbines, the flow direction may not be perpendicular to the structure. To understand the vortex shedding behind a fixed inclined cylinder, the Independence Principle (IP) has been used. The IP assumes that an inclined cylinder behaves similarly to a normal-incidence case, if only the component of the free stream velocity normal to the cylinder axis is considered. The IP neglects the effect of the axial component of the flow, which seems reasonable for small angles of inclination, but not for large angles. In the present study, a series of experiments have been conducted on a flexibly-mounted rigid cylinder placed inclined to the oncoming flow with various angles of inclination (0\textdegree{$<\theta <$}75\textdegree ) in a range of Reynolds numbers from 500 to 4000 to investigate how the angle of inclination affects VIV. A rigid cylinder was mounted on springs, and air bearings were used to reduce the structural damping of the system. The system was placed in the test-section of a recirculating water tunnel and the crossflow displacements were measured at each flow velocity. Even at high angles of inclination, large-amplitude oscillations were observed. As the angle of inclination was increased, the lock-in range (the range of reduced flow velocities for which the cylinder oscillates with a large amplitude) started at a higher reduced velocity. When only the normal component of the oncoming flow was considered, the onset of lock-in was observed to be at the same normalized flow velocity for all angles of inclination except for 75\textdegree. However, the width of the lock-in region, its pattern, the maximum amplitude of oscillations and its corresponding normalized reduced velocity were not following the results of a normal-incidence case entirely. Flow visualizations showed a vortex shedding parallel to the cylinder{${'}$}s axis for all the angles of inclination considered. The influence of a slight change in the added mass as well as the direction of the inclined cylinder on the response was studied as well.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind turbine structures (OWTs) are dynamically sensitive due to their shape and form (slender column supporting a heavy rotation mass) and also due to the different forcing functions (wind, wave, and turbine loading) acting on the structures. Designers need to ensure that the first Eigen natural frequency is not close to forcing frequencies to avoid dynamic associated effects such as resonance and fatigue damage. Such damages may result in higher maintenance costs and a lower service life. Therefore, it is crucial to get the best prediction of the first natural frequency during the early stages of a project. Other design requirements include the serviceability limit state (SLS) criteria which imposes strict pile head deflection and rotation limits. These calculations require foundation stiffness and the aim of this chapter is to provide practical methods to predict the stiffness of the foundations for any ground profile (nonuniform or layered soils) through the use of standard methods. The foundation stiffness values can then be used as an input to predict the first natural frequency of OWT system as well as checking SLS requirements. An example problem is taken to show the application of the method.},

The data show that the two protuberance shapes, a trip-wire and an overlap, are nearly identical in their effect on the aerodynamic characteristics, and that their effect depends much more on location than on size. It was found that the drag coefficient could vary by {$\pm$}40\% and that the lift coefficient could be as high as 0.7, depending on the location of the protuberance, or equivalently on the angle of attack.

  abstract = {Although there are a great many papers dedicated to the problem of a cylinder vibrating transverse to a fluid flow (YY-motion), there are almost no papers on the more practical case of vortex-induced vibration in two degrees of freedom (X,YX,Y motion) where the mass and natural frequencies are precisely the same in both XX- and YY-directions. We have designed the present pendulum apparatus to achieve both of these criteria. Even down to the low mass ratios, where m{${_\ast}$}=6m\^*\textbackslash,\{=\}\textbackslash,6, it is remarkable that the freedom to oscillate in-line with the flow affects the transverse vibration surprisingly little. The same response branches, peak amplitudes, and vortex wake modes are found for both YY-only and X,YX,Y motion. There is, however, a dramatic change in the fluid\textendash structure interactions when mass ratios are reduced below m{${_\ast}$}=6m\^*\textbackslash,\{=\}\textbackslash,6. A new amplitude response branch with significant streamwise motion appears, in what we call the `super-upper' branch, yielding massive amplitudes of 3 diameters peak-to-peak (AY{${_\ast}\sim$}1.5A\^*\_Y \textbackslash,\{\textbackslash sim\}\textbackslash, 1.5). We discover a corresponding periodic vortex wake mode, comprising a triplet of vortices being formed in each half-cycle, in what we define as a `2T' mode. We qualitatively interpret the principal vortex dynamics and vortex forces which yield a positive rate of energy transfer (e\textperiodcentered V\textbackslash dot\{e\}\_V) causing the body vibration, using the following simple equation: e\textperiodcentered V=2{$\Gamma{_\ast}$}UV{${_\ast}$}Y\textperiodcentered\textbackslash dot\{e\}\_V = 2 \{\textbackslash Gamma\}\^* U\^*\_V \textbackslash skew3\textbackslash dot\{Y\} where {$\Gamma{_\ast}\backslash$}Gamma\^* is vortex strength, UV{${_\ast}$}U\^*\_V is the speed downstream of the dominant near-wake vorticity, and Y\textperiodcentered\textbackslash skew3\textbackslash dot\{Y\} is the transverse velocity of the body. This simple approach suggests that the massive amplitude of vibration for the 2T mode is principally attributed to the energy transfer from the `third' vortex of each triplet, which is not present in the lower-amplitude 2P mode. We also find two low-speed streamwise vibration modes, which is not unexpected, since they correspond to the first and second excitation modes of vibration for flexible cantilevers. By considering equations of motion for the two degrees of freedom, we find a critical mass, m\textbackslash scriptsize\textbackslash it crit{${_\ast}$}=0.52m\^*\_\{\textbackslash hbox\{\textbackslash scriptsize\textbackslash it crit\}\} \textbackslash,\{=\}\textbackslash, 0.52, similar to recent YY-only studies, below which the large-amplitude vibrations persist to infinite flow velocity. We show that the critical mass m\textbackslash scriptsize\textbackslash it crit{${_\ast}$}m\^*\_\{\textbackslash hbox\{\textbackslash scriptsize\textbackslash it crit\}\} is the same for the XX- and YY-directions, which ensures that the shapes of X,YX, Y trajectories can retain their form as the velocity becomes large. The extensive studies of vortex-induced vibration for YY-only body motions, built up over the last 35 years, remain of strong relevance to the case of two degrees of freedom, for m{${_\ast}>$}6m\^* \textbackslash,\{{$>\rbrace\backslash$}, 6. It is only for `small' mass ratios, m{${_\ast}<$}6m\^* \textbackslash,\{{$<\rbrace\backslash$}, 6, that one observes a rather dramatic departure from previous results, which would suggest a possible modification to offshore design codes.\vphantom{\}\}}},

  abstract = {Single-blade installation is a method suitable for the installation of blades on large wind turbines. For single-blade installations on offshore monopile-type wind turbines, a jack-up vessel is often involved, and each blade is mated with the hub at the tower top. Prior to the alignment phase, the blade root and the nacelle at the tower top experience relative motions. The blade-root motions are induced by the wind loads, and the nacelle motions are due to the resonant vibrations of the monopile support structure under wave loading. To alleviate the relative motions and to facilitate the alignment process, external passive tuned mass dampers can be installed on the monopile support structures. This work investigates the application potential of tuned mass dampers in single-blade installation. Multibody simulations were conducted under collinear wind and waves conditions, and the relative motions between the blade-root and the hub were analysed. It was found that when an optimally tuned passive damper is considered for the monopile structure, the reduction in the critical motion radius can reach up to 30\%.},

  abstract = {Jack-up barges are commonly used for marine operations in the offshore oil and gas, and offshore wind industries. A critical phase within the marine operation activities is the positioning of the jack-up legs onto the seabed. During this process, large impact velocities and forces may arise from the barge's heave, roll and pitch motions, and structural damage of the legs can occur. This paper numerically investigates the effect of a flopper stopper (FS) on the motion responses of a jack-up barge from the offshore wind industry. The FS is known as a passive roll compensation device. It is suspended from the side of the barge by means of wire ropes and cantilever beams. A simple geometry of an FS is proposed, and the working principle introduced. For the loading condition before the leg-soil impact occurs, global dynamic analyses of the coupled system are conducted. Characteristic values of impact velocities are used to establish the jack-up operational limits in terms of the significant wave height and peak period. By comparing the operational limits for the barge with and without FS, it is found that FS should be placed on the weather side. At beam seas, the current FS can lead to a maximum increase in the operational wave height limit of 35\%, whereas for the other wave headings, it may not be beneficial to use FS.},

  abstract = {Single blade installation is a method for installing wind turbine blades. If a jack-up vessel is used during an o shore installation, the wind turbine blade is mainly subjected to wind loads and experiences resonant motions, and the monopile is subjected to wave-induced vibrations. The blade mating process can be challenging if large relative motions occur between the blade root and the monopile top. This study numerically models a blade installation system that consists of a pre-installed monopile and nacelle assembly, and a 5 MW blade with tugger lines. By analyzing the blade-root and the hub motion radii from time-domain simulations, we evaluate the effects of mean wind speed, wind turbulence, significant wave height, wave spectrum peak period, wind-wave misalignment, and water depth on the blade installation. For the alignment phase, the blade-root motion is critical, especially when the mean wind speed and turbulence are high. The hub motion can be important when the monopile resonant responses are prominent. The relative in-plane motions rather than the hub or the blade motion alone should be considered during the assessment. For the mating phase, the high-frequency components of the responses are important in general. Because of the dominant flange-hole motions at the monopile top, an increase in water depth reduces the success rate of mating.},

The increased range of motion of floating platforms can influence wake characteristics, affecting downstream turbines. In this work, large eddy simulations with an actuator line model are used to study downstream wake characteristics of the NREL 5 MW reference turbine mounted on the OC3-UMaine spar platform for several different metocean conditions. The simulations are carried out in the Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA) coupled with OpenFAST for the platform and turbine motion. The downstream wake characteristics of the floating platform are compared to equivalent fixedbottom cases for different wind speeds, wave heights, wind-wave alignments, and turbine yaw angles. Overall, the differences in wake shape between floating and fixed platforms are associated with mean platform displacements, while differences in turbulence are associated with timevarying platform motion. However, these observed wake differences between fixed and floating platforms are small, especially for higher wind speeds and lower wave heights.},

  abstract = {Goal, Scope and Background. This paper describes the modelling of two emerging electricity systems based on renewable energy: photovoltaic (PV) and wind power. The paper shows the approach used in the ecoinvent database for multi-output processes. Methods. Twelve different, grid-connected photovoltaic systems were studied for the situation in Switzerland. They are manufactured as panels or laminates, from mono- or polycrystalline silicon, installed on facades, slanted or flat roofs, and have a 3kWp capacity. The process data include quartz reduction, silicon purification, wafer, panel and laminate production, supporting structure and dismantling. The assumed operational lifetime is 30 years. Country-specific electricity mixes have been considered in the LCI in order to reflect the present situation for individual production stages. The assessment of wind power includes four different wind turbines with power rates between 30 kW and 800 kW operating in Switzerland and two wind turbines assumed representative for European conditions - 800 kW onshore and 2 MW offshore. The inventory takes into account the construction of the plants including the connection to the electric grid and the actual wind conditions at each site in Switzerland. Average European capacity factors have been assumed for the European plants. Eventually necessary backup electricity systems are not included in the analysis. Results and Discussion. The life cycle inventory analysis for photovoltaic power shows that each production stage may be important for specific elementary flows. A life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) shows that there are important environmental impacts not directly related to the energy use (e.g. process emissions of NO, from wafer etching). The assumption for the used supply energy mixes is important for the overall LCIA results of different production stages. The allocation of the inventory for silicon purification to different products is discussed here to illustrate how allocation has been implemented in ecoinvent. Material consumption for the main parts of the wind turbines gives the dominant contributions to the cumulative results for electricity production. The complex installation of offshore turbines, with high requirements of concrete for the foundation and the assumption of a shorter lifetime compared to onshore foundations, compensate the advantage of increased offshore wind speeds. Conclusion. The life cycle inventories for photovoltaic power plants are representative for newly constructed plants and for the average photovoltaic, mix in Switzerland in the year 2000. A scenario for a future technology helps to assess the relative influence of technology improvements for some processes in the near future (2005-2010). The differences for environmental burdens of wind power basically depend upon the capacity factor of the plants, the lifetime of the infrastructure, and the rated power. The higher these factors, the more reduced the environmental burdens are. Thus, both systems are quite dependent on meteorological conditions and the materials used for the infrastructure. Recommendation and Perspective. Many production processes for photovoltaic power are still under development. Future updates of the LCI should verify the energy uses and emissions with available data from industrial processes in operation. For the modelling of a specific power plant or power plant mixes outside of Switzerland, one has to consider the annual yield (kWh/kW(p)) and if possible also the size of the plant. Considering the steady growth of the size of wind turbines in Europe, the development of new designs, and the exploitation of offshore location with deeper waters than analysed in this study, the inventory for wind power plants may need to be updated in the future.},

A categorization index (with unique category codes, formatted as 'axis of rotation-installed location-power generation capacity') was adopted for use in this study to characterize the reviewed wind electricity generation systems. The unique category codes were labeled by integrating the names from the three wind power sub-classifications, i.e., the axis of rotation of the wind turbine [horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT), vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT)], the location of the installation [onshore (ON), offshore (OFF)], and the electricity production capacity [small (S), intermediate (I), large (L)]. The characterized wind electricity generation systems were statistically evaluated to assess the reduction in life cycle GHG emissions. A total of five unique categorization codes (HAWT-ON-S, HAWT-ON-I, HAWT-ON-L, HAWT-OFF-L, VAWT-ON-S) were designated to the 29 wind electricity generation LCA studies (representing 74 wind system cases) using the proposed categorization index.

  abstract = {The offshore wind industry currently relies on subsidy schemes to be competitive with fossil-fuel-based energy sources. For the wind industry to survive, it is vital that costs are significantly reduced for future projects. This can be partly achieved by introducing new technologies and partly through optimization of existing technologies and design methods. One of the areas where costs can be reduced is in the support structure, where better designs, cheaper fabrication and quicker installation might all be possible. The prevailing support structure design is the monopile structure, where the simple design is well suited to mass-fabrication, and the installation approach, based on conventional impact driving, is relatively low-risk and robust for most soil conditions. The range of application of the monopile for future wind farms can be extended by using more accurate engineering design methods, specifically tailored to offshore wind industry design. This paper describes how state-of-the-art optimization approaches are applied to the design of current wind farms and monopile support structures and identifies the main drivers where more accurate engineering methods could impact on a next generation of highly optimized monopiles.},

Application of vibration control systems (VCS) to OWT towers has the potential to significantly improve the dynamics of the tower and the nacelle, increasing its reliability. The first vibration mitigation approach is the classical tuned mass damped (TMD) and it is used as benchmark. In the TMD approach an additional mass is installed inside the nacelle at the top of the OWT tower. Usually, a large additional mass is required to achieve significant effective damping, which may lead to undesirable second order effects and ultimately increase the tower displacement. In the second approach, a passive vibration absorption concept is implemented, namely the Extended KDamper (EKD). The KDamper device is a special mechanical configuration consisting of an additional mass, an artificial damper and both positive and negative stiffness elements. The OWT is subjected to extreme environmental loading such as the wind and sea waves. These OWT loadings, are usually calculated based on stochastic interpolation of meteorological data or by artificial time-histories. In this study, the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory is taken into consideration in order to produce the wind load time histories. The improvement on the dynamic response of the OWT tower using vibration control systems is illustrated. Moreover, this research shown that the EKD presents a significant increase of the damping ratio with a minimal value of added mass at the top of the tower.},

Three different models are used: (1) a non-linear elasto-plastic model including hysteretic behaviour effects, (2) a linear elastic model and (3) a non-linear elastic model, using numerical simulations with an aero-hydro-servo-elastic computational tool. Depending on the environmental condition, different dynamic processes dominate the responses. For parked states, deviations between models up to 160\% were found. For wind wave-misalignment over 30o in operational cases, differences up to 180\% were found for low sea states and 119\% for high sea sates. Both nonlinear foundation damping and stiffness formulation have considerable effect on the responses, with hysteretic effects becoming crucial when aerodynamic damping is negligible in the direction of the response. Attention is required when comparing the fatigue damage only at the mudline, as larger variations between the models may occur in the embedded part of the monopile, where the absolute maximum is found.},

The integration of a wind vector provides a conception of the stream path, the curvature which has a significant role to form the flow pattern around an obstacle. When an obstacle starts from rest with a constant speed on a straight line, other conceptions of the pattern completion length and the pattern formation length are noticed as the distances attained either to a completely steady condition or a partially steady one, respectively. As a result of applying these conceptions to the measured data on a field model a criterion was obtained to verify the flow pattern completion in which the coefficients of the pressure exerted on the whole model surface can be determined.},

This study explores the use of high-precision global positioning systems (GPS) toward that end. In this study, the performance of GPS for resonant response tracking is first validated in full scale against accelerometers, and then its ability to track both background and resonant response data is verified through controlled field tests. As the valuable low-frequency regime of this sensing technology is often compromised by long-period distortions known as multipath effects; this study then presents a means to characterize this phenomenon using Fourier and wavelet spectra and the GPS Distortion Signature. The latter diagnostic is shown to isolate multipath effects in controlled field testing. However, even when a GPS Distortion Signature is not available on-site, it is shown that multipath effects can still be removed by filtering to permit a rare comparison of the relative contributions of background and resonant responses in full scale to wind tunnel predictions. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The annual wind speed occurrence frequency for the expected installation areas was used to predict the annual power generation of the wind turbine generators. It was found that the parallel combination of the induction motors exhibited a higher efficiency when the wind speed was low and the serial combination showed higher efficiency when wind speed was high. The results of predicting the annual power generation considering the regional characteristics showed that the power generation was the highest when the hydraulic motors were designed in parallel and the induction motors were designed in series.},

  abstract = {We have studied the effects of controlled damping on the amplitude and frequency response profiles of an elastically mounted cylinder in cross-flow. The dimensionless damping parameter, b*=2b/{$\rho$}LDU, which is closely related to the traditional ``mass-damping'' parameter, m*{$\zeta$}, was varied over a wide range of values through the use of a variable magnetic eddy current damping system. For low damping and sufficiently high Reynolds number we observe the previously described large-amplitude, three-branch (initial, upper, lower) response profile, and for high damping or low Reynolds number we observe the small-amplitude, two-branch (initial and lower) response profile. However we find that, because of the influence of Reynolds number, the traditional labels of ``high mass-damping'' and ``low mass-damping'' are incomplete with regard to predicting a large or small-amplitude response profile. In our experiments, as damping is systematically increased, we observe a transition between these two profiles characterized by a gradual ``erosion'' and eventual disappearance of the large-amplitude section (upper branch) and the scaling down of the lower branch region. We find that jumps from the upper to the initial branch originate on the 2S/2P boundary in the Williamson\textendash Roshko plane. Another new finding is a hysteresis between the lower branch and the desynchronized region, which only appears at low Reynolds numbers. We also explore changes in the frequency response profile, which are connected with the changes in the amplitude profile, for our upper branch cases. We observe that analogous to the three amplitude branches, there are three distinct branches for the frequency response.},

It is shown that appropriate measurements of harmonic and transient phenomena in offshore wind farms are essential for data analysis and model creation/validation of components or subsystems. The GPS synchronization, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and interference (EMI) challenges during the development, construction, testing and installation of a measurement system for multi-point, high-speed and long-term data logging is described in this paper. The presented measurement system was tested in a rough offshore environment at Avedore Holme and Gunfleet Sands offshore wind farms. The paper will describe the application of GPS technology in synchronised measurements carried out at Avedore Holme and Gunfleet Sands wind farms. Different aspects of software development and hardware configuration in order to optimise measurement systems reliability during offshore measurements will be presented. Also real-life examples of results from both offshore measurement campaigns will be described. Some limitations, improvements and results of the measurement system will be explained from both harmonic and transient measurements. The paper clearly presents possible electromagnetic interference in wind turbines that can affect measurements. Also the application of appropriate mitigation techniques such as data acquisition board configuration, coaxial cable leading, as well as usage of EMC-proof boxes for high frequency measurements is described.

  abstract = {As suggested by the strong effect resonances and feedback mechanisms can exert upon vortices shed from blunt bodies, it is proposed that the discrete frequency, self-excited vortex shedding process itself is governed by a resonance-like mechanism. With the assumption that to a first approximation the shedding frequency is determined by the behaviour in the linear regime, the resonance hypothesis is found to lead to a bifurcation condition (direct resonance condition) of the local instability eigenvalue. In a corresponding initial value formulation the same condition separates a subcritical region of locally absolute instability from a supercritical region of locally convective instability. The critical basic wake profile corresponding to the bifurcation condition is found to be near the end of the potential core. The pertinent frequency is close to experimentally found values if, in the absence of numerically determined (physically unstable) solutions of the steady Navier-Stokes equations, the steady basic wake flow is modelled realistically. For asymmetrical steady wakes a limiting asymmetry seems to exist beyond which no time-harmonic resonance could be determined. This provides a link to mixing layers where apparently only convective instabilities are possible.},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the dynamics of vortex-induced vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder with very low values of mass and damping. We use two methods to investigate this canonical problem: first we calculate the instantaneous phase between the cylinder motion and the fluid forcing; second we decompose the total hydrodynamic force into drag and lift components that act along and normal to, respectively, the instantaneous effective angle of attack. We focus on the phase dynamics in the large-amplitude\textendash response range, consisting of the initial, upper and lower ``branches'' of response. The instantaneous phase between the transverse force and displacement shows repeated phase slips separating periods of constant, or continuous-drifting, phase in the second half of the upper branch. The phase between the lift component and displacement shows strong phase locking throughout the large-amplitude range \textendash{} the average phase varies linearly with the primary frequency \textendash{} however the modulation of this phase is largest in the second half of the upper branch. These observations suggest that the large-amplitude\textendash response dynamics is driven by two distinct limit cycles \textendash{} one that is stable over a very small range of reduced velocity at the beginning of the upper branch, and another that consists of the lower branch. The chaotic oscillation between them \textendash{} the majority of the upper branch \textendash{} occurs when neither limit cycle is stable. The transition between the upper and lower branches is marked by intermittent switching with epochs of time where different states exist at a constant reduced velocity. These different states are clearly apparent in the phase between the lift and displacement, illustrating the utility of the force decomposition employed. The decomposed force measurements also show that the drag component acts as a damping factor whereas the lift component provides the necessary fluid excitation for free vibration to be sustained.},

  abstract = {The interaction of vortex shedding from a circular cylinder with an inflow which has low-amplitude periodic velocity oscillations (perturbations) superimposed upon it, was investigated experimentally by means of particle image velocimetry. The experiments were made at three perturbation frequencies across the lock-on range in which the vortex shedding frequency is synchronized with the subharmonic of the imposed frequency. The basic wake pattern in this range is antisymmetric vortex shedding, i.e. the familiar 2S mode. The timing of vortex shedding is defined with respect to the cross-flow oscillation of the wake which is found to play a critical role. Quantitative analysis of the phase-referenced patterns of vorticity distribution in the wake shows that a vortex is actually shed from the cylinder when the cross-flow oscillation of the wake is strongest, marked by a sudden drop in the computed vortex strength. At the middle of the lock-on range, shedding occurs near the minimum inflow velocity in the cycle or, equivalently, during the forward stroke of a cylinder oscillating in-line with the flow. It is argued that the imposed timing of vortex shedding relative to the cylinder motion induces a negative excitation from the fluid, which might explain why the in-line response of a freely vibrating cylinder exhibits two positive excitation regions separated by the lock-on region found in forced oscillations.},

Offshore wind energy has been highlighted as one of the more promising energy sources and in this application, the foundation structure for a typical installation contributes significantly to the overall levelised cost of energy. With this in mind, a faceted monopile foundation design and the review of its critical evaluation is presented. This type of design lends itself well to mass production and upscaling, both factors seen to reduce the overall cost of gathered energy. The evaluation of the design is performed through comparison with a conventional, circular monopile design. The comparison is undertaken using conventional design criteria as outlined by the DNV standards body. A finite element model was used to evaluate the structural performance of the designs. It is shown that the faceted design has a higher fatigue resilience than the conventional round design. Also, the fatigue damage caused to the monopile during pile driving installation is estimated from the conducted scaled down test where a series of strain gauge signals were collected to allow for stress measurement at specific points of interest. The feasibility of the proposed faceted monopile design is supported based on this critical evaluation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

For the treatment of conventional boundary layer winds, a gust loading factor approach has been widely adapted in most international codes and standards for the design of buildings. Wind turbine towers, though fundamentally different from buildings when viewed as a multi-body system featuring a tower/nacelle and blades, may be treated much in the same way with modified gust loading factors. This paper introduces a possible approach to mesh conventional treatments of gust loading factors with those of newly introduced gust-front factors on wind turbine towers. Much like gust-front factors for buildings, this approach encapsulates many of the varied kinematic and dynamic changes associated with nonstationary characteristics of gust-fronts originating from thunderstorms/downbursts and the changing aerodynamics on wind turbine towers. From an example of a wind turbine tower system, gust-front loading effects as compared to those of boundary layer winds are investigated.},

Surprisingly, there is very little scientific literature showing how this reduction is being achieved. The objective of this paper is to analyse the evidence behind cost reduction in one of the most significant cost elements of offshore wind farms, the installation of foundations and turbines. This cost is directly dependent on the daily rates of the installation vessels and on the days it takes to install those wind farm elements. Therefore, we collected installation data from 87 wind farms installed from 2000 to 2017, to establish the exact time for installation in each. The results show that advances have reached 70\% reduction in installation times throughout the period for the whole set, turbine plus foundation. Most of these improvements (and the corresponding impact in reducing costs) relate to the larger size of turbines installed nowadays. There is, therefore, not any leap forward in the installation process, but only incremental improvements applied to turbines that are now four times as large as in 2000.},

  abstract = {The near wake of a wavy cylinder has been experimentally investigated using various techniques, including Laser Doppler Anemometer, Laser-Induced Fluorescence Visualization and Digital Particle Image Velocimetry. The work aims to provide understanding to the mechanism of the cross-flow around a wavy cylinder as well as to comprehend why the introduction of relatively small degrees of spanwise waviness could have a significant effect on drag reduction and a corresponding suppression of cylinder vibration. Distributions of the mean and fluctuating velocity components along the streamwise, spanwise and transverse direction are presented. The development of the flow patterns and the corresponding vortex interactions are obtained by flow visualization. The experimental results indicated that the average vortex formation length behind the wavy cylinder is longer than that behind the circular cylinder. It appears that there is a direct link between the long formation length and drag reduction and vibration suppression. For the wavy cylinder, the wake on the saddle plane has a longer vortex formation region and a more rapid reverse flow, as well as being wider than that on the nodal plane. Furthermore, the spanwise flow is from the saddle plane towards the nodal plane on both sides of the wavy cylinder. It was deduced that the free shear layers shed from the points near the saddles extend along the spanwise direction, while the shear layers near the nodes contract. The turbulence correlations show that the vortex streets in the circular cylinder wake are more regular, while the wavy cylinder wake shows more incoherent turbulence due to enhanced turbulent mixing; a consequence of three-dimensional (3-D) effects. The mean velocity and turbulence data also provide an important database for the validation of turbulence modelling and 3-D numerical simulations.},

Offshore resources benefit from higher energy density, smaller visual impacts, and higher availability levels. Offshore locations at the West of Crete obtain wind availability approximate to 80\%, combining this with the installation potential for large scale modern wind turbines (rated power) then expected annual benefits are immense. Temporal variability of production is a limiting factor for wider adaptation of large offshore farms. To this end multi-generation with wave energy can alleviate issues of non-generation for wind. Spatio-temporal correlation of wind and wave energy production exhibit that wind and wave hybrid stations can contribute significant amounts of clean energy, while at the same time reducing spatial constrains and public acceptance issues. Offshore technologies can be combined as co-located or not, altering contribution profiles of wave energy to non-operating wind turbine production. In this study a co-located option contributes up to 626 h per annum, while a non co-located solution is found to complement over 4000 h of a non-operative wind turbine. Findings indicate the opportunities associated not only in terms of capital expenditure reduction, but also in the ever important issue of renewable variability and grid stability.},

  abstract = {The objective of this numerical study is to investigate the effect of spanwise grooves on the suppression of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and the reduction of drag force. For this purpose, we consider a standard configuration of the elastically mounted circular cylinder, which is free to vibrate in both streamwise and transverse directions with identical natural frequency. We introduce a novel staggered groove configuration whose geometry is especially designed by offsetting the cross-sectional portion of the cylinder continuously along the spanwise direction. We assess the characteristic VIV responses of the proposed staggered groove configuration against the helical surface grooves for the identical dimensions and physical conditions. The staggered and helical groove configurations differ only in their arrangement of cross-section geometry along the spanwise direction. Three-dimensional coupled fluid-structure simulations are conclucted at low mass and damping values with moderate Reynolds number of Re = 4800. The effective width and the depth of surface grooves are determined to characterize the size effects for the assessment of staggered and helical groove configurations. Results show that the staggered groove configuration is effective in suppressing VIV, wherein the net reductions of 37\% in the peak transverse amplitude and about 25\% in the mean drag coefficient are observed in comparison to the plain cylinder counterpart. Staggered groove configuration produces three dominant effects by introducing a continuous jump in the cross-sectional geometry along the spanwise direction: (i) reduction of the spanwise correlation, (ii) enhancement of the three-dimensional effects in the near-wake flow, and (iii) broadening of the frequency spectra of fluid forces. As a result of these physical effects, the transfer of energy from the surrounding fluid flow to the vibrating grooved-cylinder system is reduced as compared to its plain cylinder counterpart. Owing to the simplicity of mechanical design and the ease of installation, the proposed passive control concept has a potential application to deep water marine risers and tall structures in a wind environment.

  abstract = {Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) is a major concern of the offshore oil industry. This problem leads to fatigue failure in the marine risers and causes costly replacement of the risers. Appendages such as helical strakes have proven that VIV can be eliminated but at the cost of increased drag. Increased drag reduces the time that the riser can operate. This thesis looks at adding airfoils to cylinders to both eliminate VIV as well as reducing drag. Two sets of tests were performed at the MIT Towing Tank to determine the effectiveness of these airfoils. The first tests utilized a flexible to model a riser. The second set of tests used a rigid cylinder to better understand the dynamics of the system. The airfoils were able to achieve both goals when the airfoils are aligned with the flow. Future work needs to be completed to study the airfoils when they are not aligned with the flow.},

To develop the high resolution spatial calibration model, artificial neural network (ANN) models were used to construct the wind and bathymetric maps. Accuracy and consistency of wind/bathymetric spatial calibration models were obtained using analysis of variance. The optimization problem was defined to maximize the energy density satisfying the criteria of maximum water depth and maximum distance from the coastline.

  abstract = {With single elements weighing up to hundreds of tonnes and lifted to heights of 100 meters, off shore wind turbines can pose risks to personnel, assets, and the environment during installation and maintenance interventions. To increase safety during off shore lifts, this study focuses on solutions for human-free lifting operations. Ideas in the categories of logistics, connections, as well as guidance and control, were discussed and ranked by means of a multi-criteria decision analysis. Based upon 38 survey responses weighting 21 predefined decision criteria, the most promising concepts were selected. Logistically, pre-assembled systems would reduce the number of lifts and thus reduce the risk. A MATLAB-based code has been developed to optimise installation time, lifted weight, and number of lifts. Automated bolting and seafastening solutions have high potential to increase safety during the transport of the wind turbine elements and, additionally, speed up the process. Finally, the wind turbine should be lifted on top of the support structure without having personnel being under the load. A multidirectional mechanical guiding element has been designed and tested successfully in combination with visual guidance by cameras in a small-scale experiment.},

  abstract = {During the commissioning and stand-still cycles of wind turbines, the rotor is often stopped or even locked leaving the rotor blades at a standstill. When the blades are at a standstill, angles of attack on the blades can be very high, and it is therefore possible that they experience vortex-induced vibrations. This experiment and analysis helps to explain the different regimes of flow at very high angles of attack, particularly on moderately twisted and tapered blades. A single blade was tested at two different flow velocities at a range of angles of attack with flow tuft visualization and hotwire measurements of the wake. Hotwire wake measurements were able to show the gradual inception and ending of certain flow regimes. The power spectral densities of these measurements were normalized in terms of Strouhal number based on the projected chord to show that certain wake features have a relatively constant Strouhal number. The shedding frequency appears then to be relatively independent of chord taper and twist. Vortex generators (VGs) were tested but were found to have little influence in this case. Gurney flaps were found to modify the wake geometry, stall onset angles, and in some cases the shedding frequency.},

A numerical model of the coupled system of the monopile and vessel is established. The disturbed wave field near the vessel is investigated and observed to be affected by the diffraction and radiation of the vessel. The shielding effects of the vessel during the continuous lowering operation are accounted for in this study by developing an external Dynamic Link Library (DLL) that interacts with SIMO program in the time-domain simulations. The DLL is implemented by interpolating fluid kinematics between pre-defined wave points near the vessel. Based on the time-domain simulations, the critical responses, such as the motions of the monopile, the tensions in the lift wire and the contact forces in the gripper device in the disturbed wave fields, are compared with those in incident wave conditions. The results indicate that a great reduction in these extreme responses can be achieved when the shielding effects are considered. The sensitivity study of the responses in different wave directions is performed. The results indicate different behaviours with different wave directions and with short or long waves. A comparison of the responses when using a floating vessel and a jack-up vessel is also studied and can be used to support the choice of installation vessel type. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to present a method for assessing the allowable sea states for the initial hammering process (shallow penetrations in the seabed) of a monopile (MP) using a heavy lift floating vessel (HLV) for use in the planning of the operation. This method combines the commonly used installation procedure and the time-domain simulations of the sequential installation activities. The purpose of the time-domain simulation is to quantitatively study the system dynamic responses to identify critical events that may jeopardize the installation and the corresponding limiting response parameters. Based on the allowable limits and the characteristic values of the limiting response parameters, a methodology to find the allowable sea states is proposed. Case studies are presented to show the application of the methodology. The numerical model of the dynamic HLV\textendash MP system includes the coupling between HLV and MP via a gripper device, and soil\textendash MP interaction at different MP penetration depths. It is found that the limiting parameters are the gripper force and the inclination of the MP. The systematic approach proposed herein is general and applies to other marine operations.},

  abstract = {Large-scale model testing of a tensioned steel riser in well-defined sheared current was performed at Han\o ytangen outside Bergen, Norway in 1997. The length of the model was 90m and the diameter was 3cm. The aim of the present work is to look into this information and try to improve the understanding of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) for cases with very high order of responding modes, and in particular to study if and under which circumstances the riser motions would be single-mode or multi-mode. The measurement system consisted of 29 biaxial gauges for bending moment. The signals are processed to yield curvature and displacement and further to identify modes of vibration. A modal approach is used successfully employing a combination of signal filtering and least-squares fitting of precalculated mode-shapes. As a part of the modal analysis, it is demonstrated that the equally spaced instrumentation limited the maximum mode number to be extracted to be equal to the number of instrumentation locations. This imposed a constraint on the analysis of in-line (IL) vibration, which occurs at higher frequencies and involves higher modes than cross-flow (CF). The analysis has shown that in general the riser response was irregular (i.e. broad-banded) and that the degree of irregularity increases with the flow speed. In some tests distinct spectral peaks could be seen, corresponding to a dominating mode. No occurrences of single-mode (lock-in) were seen. The IL response is more broad-banded than the CF response and contains higher frequencies. The average value of the displacement r.m.s over the length of the riser is computed to indicate the magnitude of VIV motion during one test. In the CF direction the average displacement is typically 1/4 of the diameter, almost independent of the flow speed. For the IL direction the values are in the range 0.05\textendash 0.08 of the diameter. The peak frequency taken from the spectra of the CF displacement at riser midpoint show approximately to be equal to the Strouhal frequency. The peak frequency in IL direction was typically twice the Strouhal frequency.},

The result is that all frequency components of the input signal are shifted in time (usually delayed) by the same constant amount (the slope of the linear function), which is referred to as the group delay. Consequently, there is no phase distortion due to the time delay of frequencies relative to one another. For discrete-time signals, perfect linear phase is easily achieved with a finite impulse response (FIR) filter by having coefficients which are symmetric or anti-symmetric. Approximations can be achieved with infinite impulse response (IIR) designs, which are more computationally efficient. Several techniques are: a Bessel transfer function which has a maximally flat group delay approximation function a phase equalizer},

Scour leads to the excavation of sediments around the foundations of structures, reducing the safe capacity of the structures. The phenomenon of pier scour is extremely complex because of the combined effects of the vortex system involving time-dependent flow patterns and sediment transport mechanisms. A real-time scour monitoring system can improve the safety of structures and afford cost-effective operations by preventing premature or unnecessary maintenance. This paper proposes an on-site scour monitoring system using visible light communication (VLC) modules for offshore wind turbine installations. A flume experiment revealed that the system was highly sensitive and accurate in monitoring seabed scour processes. This arrayed-VLC sensory system, proposed in this paper, has considerable potential for safety monitoring and also can contribute to improving the accuracy of empirical scour formulas for sustainable maintenance in the life cycle of offshore structures.},

  abstract = {A new load reduction concept is being developed for the two-bladed prototype of the Skywind 3.5MW wind turbine. Due to transport and installation advantages both offshore and in complex terrain two-bladed turbine designs are potentially more cost-effective than comparable three-bladed configurations. A disadvantage of two-bladed wind turbines is the increased fatigue loading, which is a result of asymmetrically distributed rotor forces. The innovative load reduction concept of the Skywind prototype consists of a combination of cyclic pitch control and tumbling rotor kinematics to mitigate periodic structural loading. Aerodynamic design tools must be able to model correctly the advanced dynamics of the rotor. In this paper the impact of the aerodynamic modelling approach is investigated for critical operational modes of a two-bladed wind turbine. Using a lifting line free wake vortex code (FVM) the physical limitations of the classical blade element momentum theory (BEM) can be evaluated. During regular operation vertical shear and yawed inflow are the main contributors to periodic blade load asymmetry. It is shown that the near wake interaction of the blades under such conditions is not fully captured by the correction models of BEM approach. The differing prediction of local induction causes a high fatigue load uncertainty especially for two-bladed turbines. The implementation of both cyclic pitch control and a tumbling rotor can mitigate the fatigue loading by increasing the aerodynamic and structural damping. The influence of the time and space variant vorticity distribution in the near wake is evaluated in detail for different cyclic pitch control functions and tumble dynamics respectively. It is demonstrated that dynamic inflow as well as wake blade interaction have a significant impact on the calculated blade forces and need to be accounted for by the aerodynamic modelling approach. Aeroelastic simulations are carried out using the high fidelity multi body simulation software SIMPACK. The aerodynamic loads are calculated using ECN's AeroModule and NREL's BEM code Aerodyn13.},

The model is based on the Kraichnan-Tennekes random sweeping hypothesis, capturing the decorrelation in time while including a mean wind velocity in the streamwise direction. In the resulting model, the streamwise velocity space-time correlation is expressed as a convolution of the pure space correlation with an analytical temporal decorrelation kernel. Hence, the spatiotemporal structure of velocity fluctuations in wind farms can be derived from the spatial correlations only. We then explore the applicability of the model to predict spatiotemporal correlations in turbulent flows in wind farms. Comparisons of the model with data from a large eddy simulation of flow in a large, spatially periodic wind farm are performed, where needed model parameters such as spatial and temporal integral scales and spatial correlations are determined from the large eddy simulation. Good agreement is obtained between the model and large eddy simulation data showing that spatial data may be used to model the full spatiotemporal structure of fluctuations in wind farms.},

The Van der Pol and Rayleigh oscillators \textendash non-linear physical systems, which attain limit cycles under self-induced vibrations \textendash{} are often applied in literature to describe the aeroelastic force. Among VIV models, the paper focuses on the model developed by Vickery and Basu (1983). In the paper, the quadrature component of the force as a function of the oscillation amplitude in lock-in is investigated through forced-vibration wind tunnel experiments on a circular cylinder. In presence of aeroelastic interaction, the positive quadrature component corresponds to energy transferred to the structure, which then acts as negative aerodynamic damping. The experiments reveal an amplitude-dependent behaviour of the aerodynamic damping with positive curvature.

The Van der Pol and Rayleigh oscillators \textendash non-linear physical systems, which attain limit cycles under self-induced vibrations \textendash{} are often applied in literature to describe the aeroelastic force. Among VIV models, the paper focuses on the model developed by Vickery and Basu (1983). In the paper, the quadrature component of the force as a function of the oscillation amplitude in lock-in is investigated through forced-vibration wind tunnel experiments on a circular cylinder. In presence of aeroelastic interaction, the positive quadrature component corresponds to energy transferred to the structure, which then acts as negative aerodynamic damping. The experiments reveal an amplitude-dependent behaviour of the aerodynamic damping with positive curvature.

  abstract = {The paper presents free-vibration wind tunnel tests on the aeroelastic model of a free-standing tower that shows vortex-induced vibrations in the lock-in range. Previous research by the authors focused on the investigation of the negative aerodynamic damping through forced-vibration tests. This knowledge allowed a realistic prediction for the maxima of the cross-wind oscillation amplitudes. In view of fatigue analysis, however, not only the maxima, rather a proper characterization of the cross-wind response is needed to determine the actual damage accumulation. Depending on the reduced wind velocity and the Scruton number of the vibrating structure, the experiments on the aeroelastic model in free vibrations show evidence of an intermittent \textendash{} mathematically speaking quasi-periodic \textendash{} behavior. It results from a beating effect between the natural oscillation frequency of the structure and the vortex shedding load, which may lock-in and lock-out in consequence of low frequency turbulence fluctuations. In addition, the frequency of the vortex shedding load along the height of the structure varies due to the varying mean velocity according to the wind profile and the varying Strouhal number. This exhibits smaller values close to the tip region. Outcomes of this investigation are the estimation of the negative aerodynamic damping through free-vibration wind tunnel tests and the estimation of the fatigue lifetime considering the quasi-periodic aeroelastic response through a rainflow fatigue load cycle counting.},

Examples include oil and gas platforms, wind turbines and shipwrecks. One of the hypothesised effects is an increased genetic connectivity among natural populations due to new populations growing on man-made structures that may act as stepping stones. However, few data are available on genetic connectivity among organisms inhabiting artificial offshore structures. Here, we present a study on the common fouling amphipod Jassa herdmani from offshore structures in the southern North Sea. Partial mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome-c-oxidase 1, N = 514) were obtained from artificial structures at 17 locations in the southern North Sea, including 13 shipwrecks, 2 wind turbines and 2 platforms. Samples from these locations were significantly differentiated, meaning that strong population structure exists for this species in the area. Levels of intraspecific variation were consistent with stable population sizes. No evidence was found for isolation by distance. Using coalescent simulations, the oldest population subdivision events were estimated to date back to the time the study area was flooded following the Last Glacial Maximum. We therefore tentatively conclude that J. herdmani may have colonised man-made structures from previously existing populations on the sea floor, and that the increase in offshore installations has not led to an overall increase in genetic connectivity for this species.},

For in-phase motion of the two cylinders, the upper extent of the lock-on region is amplitude limited. Within each of the regions of lock-on, different phase angles lead to a variety of patterns of interacting vortices; nevertheless, the general form of the near-wake velocity spectrum is the same for all patterns. Outside the region of locked-on response, the pattern of vortex formation is repetitive at a multiple of the period of the cylinder oscillation. At a given frequency of excitation, several classes of modulated vortex patterns are attainable by altering the phase angle; these patterns have, however, the same modulation period.

The cylinder system is subjected to controlled excitation over a range of excitation frequency and phase angle between the oscillating cylinders. Use of the hydrogen bubble technique allows visualization of the wake regions and laser-Doppler anemometry leads to wake spectra. It is possible to attain locked-on response, such that the near-wake structure is phase-locked to the motion of the cylinder system, over a much wider range of excitation frequency than for the corresponding single cylinder. Outside the region of locked-on response, modulated, highly repetitive wake patterns occur; these patterns repeat at a multiple of the period of the cylinder oscillation. For closely spaced cylinders, it is possible to attain a regime sensitive to the phase angle between the cylinders; transformation between locked-on and modulated response occurs when the phase angle is varied. The foregoing types of modulated and locked-on response can be classified according to the type of spectrum of the velocity fluctuation in the near-wake. These spectra can exhibit a large number of peaks, each of which can be traced to one or more of the following origins: the frequency of the cylinder oscillation and its harmonics; the inherent vortex formation frequency from the two-cylinder system; a modulation frequency; and sum and difference components of the foregoing.},

What is the global capacity for energy production by the wind? Will the added turbulence and reduced wind speeds generated by massive wind farms cool or heat the surface? Can wind farms affect precipitation? It is also shown through life-cycle analysis how wind energy can reduce the atmospheric emission of eight air pollutants.

  abstract = {Slender structures with a bluff non-axisymmetric cross-section are prone to both vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and transverse galloping. When the mass-damping parameter of the system is low, the two phenomena can interfere giving rise to a peculiar type of instability, for which the quasi-steady theory does not apply, and therefore which one may call ``unsteady galloping''. Since for large structures (such as high-rise towers or bridge pylons) this phenomenon seems to be potentially an issue, rather than the quasi-steady galloping, it is particularly important to verify whether the former also occurs in realistic turbulent wind flows, and to understand its specific features. With this aim in mind, static and dynamic wind tunnel tests have been carried out on a two-dimensional rectangular cylinder with a side ratio of 1.5 (having the short side perpendicular to the flow) immersed in various grid-induced homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. From a quasi-steady perspective, the static tests showed the proneness to galloping instability of the considered cross-section even in highly turbulent flow, though strongly dependent on the integral length scale of turbulence. In addition, they revealed an attenuation of the strength of vortex shedding, but suggested an increased tendency of VIV and galloping to interfere as compared to the smooth-flow case. The dynamic tests confirmed this tendency and highlighted a complicated behavior of the model in turbulent flow, with some features that still remain unexplained. In particular, even larger values of the mass-damping parameter of the system are necessary for the quasi-steady theory to be able to predict correctly the galloping instability threshold. Another important result is that the integral scale of turbulence was found to play a key role also in the unsteady galloping behavior of the considered rectangular cylinder.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing need for energy from renewable resources, a large number of offshore wind farms are planned to be constructed in the near future. Despite the plethora of available foundation concepts for offshore wind turbines, the monopile foundation is the most widely adopted concept in practice. To predict the installation process for a monopile a so-called drivability study is performed. Such a study allows one to decide on a number of key parameters for the installation process, such as, the appropriate size of the hydraulic hammer, the number of hammer blows and energy input needed to reach the final penetration depth, and the induced stresses in the system. The latter is important for the prediction of the fatigue life of the pile. Currently, drivability studies are based on one-dimensional wave equation models as first proposed by Smith in the 1950s. These models are valid as long as the diameter of the pile is small compared to the excited wavelengths in the structure due to the hammer impact. For large-diameter monopiles that are currently being used in the offshore wind industry, the latter condition is not met and the effect of stress wave dispersion can no longer be neglected. In this paper the classical wave equation model is amended by an extra term which accounts for the lateral inertia of the crosssection, resulting in the so-called Rayleigh-Love rod theory. With this new model, a parametric study is performed in which the effect of stress wave dispersion on the induced stresses and the number of hammer blows needed to reach the final penetration depth are assessed. A comparison with the results obtained from the classical model is also included in order to define the applicability range of the models. It is shown that the effect of stress wave dispersion can not be neglected for a drivability study of large-diameter monopiles. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Modulation is used by singers and other vocalists to modify characteristics of their voices, such as loudness or pitch. Modulation is also a technical term to express the multiplication of the original signal by another, usually periodic, signal. In electronics and telecommunications, modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a separate signal that typically contains information to be transmitted. The term analog or digital modulation is used when the modulating signal is analog or digital, respectively. Most radio systems in the 20th century used analog modulation techniques: frequency modulation (FM) or amplitude modulation (AM) for radio broadcast. Most, if not all, modern transmission systems use QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) which changes the amplitude and phase of the (digital) carrier signal. In music production, modulation is the process of gradually changing sound properties in order to reproduce a sense of movement and depth in audio recordings. It involves the use of a source signal (known as a modulator) to control another signal (a carrier) through a variety of sound effects and methods of synthesis.A modulator is a device that performs modulation. A demodulator (sometimes detector or demod) is a device that performs demodulation, the inverse of modulation.  A modem (from modulator\textendash demodulator) can perform both operations. The aim of analog modulation is to transfer an analog baseband (or lowpass) signal, for example an audio signal or TV signal, over an analog bandpass channel at a different frequency, for example over a limited radio frequency band or a cable TV network channel. The aim of digital modulation is to transfer a digital bit stream over an analog communication channel, for example over the public switched telephone network (where a bandpass filter limits the frequency range to 300\textendash 3400 Hz) or over a limited radio frequency band. Analog and digital modulation facilitate frequency division multiplexing (FDM), where several low pass information signals are transferred simultaneously over the same shared physical medium, using separate passband channels (several different carrier frequencies). The aim of digital baseband modulation methods, also known as line coding, is to transfer a digital bit stream over a baseband channel, typically a non-filtered copper wire such as a serial bus or a wired local area network. The aim of pulse modulation methods is to transfer a narrowband analog signal, for example, a phone call over a wideband baseband channel or, in some of the schemes, as a bit stream over another digital transmission system.},

  abstract = {In this study, we make extensive measurements of the fluid forces on a cylinder that is controlled to oscillate transverse to a free stream at Re=4000. These measurements are used to create very high resolution contour plots (considerably higher than in any previous study) of the magnitude of fluid forcing, and its phase relative to the cylinder motion (as well as other fluid forcing quantities) in the plane of normalized amplitude and wavelength. Previous contours of force have been assumed to be continuous in the amplitude\textendash wavelength plane, despite the fact that jumps in the fluid forcing and vortex formation modes were known to occur in other studies, including free vibration. In this investigation, we find clear discontinuities in the force contours, and we are thus able to identify boundaries separating different fluid forcing regimes. These appear remarkably similar to boundaries separating different vortex shedding modes in the regime map of Williamson and Roshko [1988. Vortex formation in the wake of an oscillating cylinder. Journal of Fluids and Structures 2, 355\textendash 381]. Measurements of vorticity fields confirm the modes of vortex formation in each regime; we find the 2S, 2P, and P+S modes, as well as a regime where the vortex formation is not synchronized with the cylinder oscillation. A new characteristic, which is only observable with very high-resolution data, is the existence of a region where two vortex formation regimes overlap. In the overlap region, we identify a distinct mode of vortex formation where two pairs of vortices are shed per cycle of oscillation (similar to the 2P mode) but the secondary vortex is much weaker, which we have termed `2POVERLAP', or simply the `2PO' mode. The wake can switch intermittently between the 2P and 2PO modes, even as the cylinder is oscillating with constant amplitude and frequency. The highest amplitude yielding positive fluid excitation lies inside the overlap region, therefore a study of the vortex dynamics in this region is essential to understanding the behavior of a free vibration system at peak amplitude response.},

  abstract = {In order to predict response and wake modes for elastically mounted circular cylinders in a fluid flow, we employ controlled-vibration experiments, comprised of prescribed transverse vibration of a cylinder in the flow, over a wide regime of amplitude and frequency. A key to this study is the compilation of high-resolution contour plots of fluid force, in the plane of normalized amplitude and wavelength. With such resolution, we are able to discover discontinuities in the force and phase contours, which enable us to clearly identify boundaries separating different fluid-forcing regimes. These appear remarkably similar to boundaries separating different vortex-formation modes in the map of regimes by Williamson \& Roshko (J. Fluids Struct., vol. 2, 1988, pp. 355\textendash 381). Vorticity measurements exhibit the 2S, 2P and P + S vortex modes, as well as a regime in which the vortex formation is not synchronized with the body vibration. By employing such fine-resolution data, we discover a high-amplitude regime in which two vortex-formation modes overlap. Associated with this overlap regime, we identify a new distinct mode of vortex formation comprised of two pairs of vortices formed per cycle, where the secondary vortex in each pair is much weaker than the primary vortex. This vortex mode, which we define as the 2POVERLAP mode (2PO), is significant because it is responsible for generating the peak resonant response of the body. We find that the wake can switch intermittently between the 2P and 2PO modes, even as the cylinder is vibrating with constant amplitude and frequency. By examining the energy transfer from fluid to body motion, we predict a free-vibration response which agrees closely with measurements for an elastically mounted cylinder. In this work, we introduce the concept of an `energy portrait', which is a plot of the energy transfer into the body motion and the energy dissipated by damping, as a function of normalized amplitude. Such a plot allows us to identify stable and unstable amplitude-response solutions, dependent on the rate of change of net energy transfer with amplitude (the sign of dE*/dA*). Our energy portraits show how the vibration system may exhibit a hysteretic mode transition or intermittent mode switching, both of which correspond with such phenomena measured from free vibration. Finally, we define the complete regime in the amplitude\textendash wavelength plane in which free vibration may exist, which requires not only a periodic component of positive excitation but also stability of the equilibrium solutions.},

The most well-known statistical characteristic of an LES subgrid-scale model is its dissipation (energy transfer to unresolved scales), and many models are directly or indirectly formulated and tuned for consistency of this characteristic. However, in complex turbulent flows, many other subgrid statistical characteristics are important. These include such quantities as mean subgrid stress, subgrid transport of resolved Reynolds stress, and dissipation anisotropy. Also important are the statistical characteristics of models that account for filters that do not commute with differentiation and of the discrete numerical operators in the LES equations. We review the known statistical characteristics of subgrid models to assess these characteristics and the importance of their a priori consistency. We hope that this analysis will be helpful in continued development of LES models.},

However, with their increasing distance from the shore, greater water depths, and increasing sizes of the plants, the industry has to face the challenge to develop sustainable installation procedures. Important limiting factors for offshore wind farm installation are the weather conditions and installation strategies. In this context, the focus of this research is the investigation of the most effective approach to installing offshore wind farms at sea, including the effects of weather conditions. This target is achieved through the implementation of a discrete-event simulation approach which includes the analysis of the environmental conditions, distance matrix, vessel characteristics, and assembly scenarios. The model maps the logistics chain in the offshore wind industry. A deterministic and a probabilistic metocean data method have been compared and cross validated. The results point to a good agreement between the two considered models, while highlighting the huge risks to the time and cost of the installation due to the stochastic nature of the weather. We suggest that simulations may improve and reduce these risks in the planning process of offshore wind farms.},

Space for much larger projects is available in shallow coastal waters compared to land. To assess wind power potential in the western coast of India, first the bathymetric data are divided into three regions, i.e. 0-10, 10-20 and 20-35 m respectively, suitable for fixed-bottom foundation technology. Next, the wind data of several meteorological stations are collected from WindSat satellite. For a given bathymetry, using the characteristics of wind turbine, calculations are made for estimating average wind speed, wind power density and average output of wind turbine. Results of the preliminary study show that there exists a total available area of 67,622 sq. km (up to a depth of 35 m), suitable for installation of offshore wind turbines. Further, results reveal that within the total effective area, the average annual power generation of 477 and 437 TWh respectively, could be achieved using GE 3.6s and Repower 5M commercial offshore turbines.},

The initial\textendash upper branch transition is hysteretic. The maximum amplitude of transverse oscillations is 0.7D. This value is larger than that observed in the laminar regime and smaller than that reported earlier for large Re. Intermittency is observed in the transition between upper and lower branches. During the transition, the fraction of time spent by the cylinder in lower branch increases with U⁎. Soft-lock-in is observed on the upper branch. Although the frequency of vortex shedding and the cylinder vibration match, they are different than the natural frequency of the spring-mass system. The mode of vortex shedding is 2S on the initial branch while it is 2P along the lower branch. Perhaps, for the first time, 2S mode of vortex shedding is found along the upper branch.

In addition to primary and secondary hystereses near the ends of the lock-in regime, multiple states of the fluid-structure system exist in the middle of the lock-in regime as well. One of the two states is associated with large amplitude of cylinder oscillation. The response of the cylinder, for this state, lies on the classically known lower branch. In the other state, the cylinder exhibits low oscillation amplitude. Depending on the mass ratio and reduced speed this state may either be synchronized or desynchronized with the wake. A new branch of cylinder response has been identified for the lock-in state in this regime. The time histories of cylinder displacement and force coefficients on this branch are similar to that observed on the initial branch. In view of this, the new branch is referred to as initial branch (II). The variation of frequency of cylinder oscillation and phase between cylinder displacement and lift coefficient along IB(II) is studied.},

  abstract = {Although flow past cylinders has a vast spectrum of applications in various fields of engineering, the existence of flow-induced vibrations (FIVs) add a need for a more precise and thorough approach when studying such flows. In this context, this work investigates the FIVs' mechanism due to two square cylinders placed in tandem arrangement through a characteristics-based-split (CBS) finite element method. Both cylinders, with a low mass ratio (mr = 2), are free to oscillate in in-line and transverse directions. The center-to-center distance of 5D (D being the cylinder side width) is kept fixed between the cylinders. The Reynolds number (Re) is ranged from 40 to 200 with an increment of 40, and computations are carried out for the reduced velocity (Ur) ranging from 3 to 13 under each Re value. Results show that the effects of Re and Ur on the dynamic responses are qualitatively similar for both cylinders. However, effects on the downstream cylinder are stronger due to the upstream wake. For Re equal to or beyond 120, the in-line low-frequency characteristic becomes obvious at some higher values of Ur for the upstream cylinder, whereas it exists over a wide range of Ur for the downstream cylinder. For lower Re (up to 120), cylinders show steady behavior at Ur = 5. However, for higher Re, they vibrate with the maximum amplitudes (especially the in-line amplitude of the downstream cylinder), and show complex wake flow at the same Ur. Compared to higher Re, the maximum vibration amplitudes in the transverse direction of lower Re are relatively higher, while the opposite trend is observed for in-line vibration amplitudes. Several unstable trajectories are also identified other than the typical figure-eight trajectories. In context of vortex shedding, different permutation of steady state, 2S, P+S, and complex modes are observed for different values of Re. It is also noted that the vortex shedding pattern keeps changing in the far wake for higher Re.},

We propose an application of detached eddy simulation (DES) approach for simulations of incompressible Navier\textendash Stokes flows over cylindrical structures coupled with its rigid body motions. In this approach, a hybrid turbulence model based on Reynolds average Navier\textendash Stokes (RANS) and large eddy simulations (LES) is implemented for modelling of high Reynolds number flows over free oscillating cylinders where near wall flow features are modelled with RANS and LES is employed for resolving wake dynamics. The proposed approach is validated against several experimental set ups of fixed cylinder as well as cylinders under vortex induced vibrations. A straightforward implementation of the proposed DES approach provides more reliable and accurate numerical results than traditional URANS for high Reynolds number flows in predictions of forces acting on cylinders and their responses. Numerical experiment using the presented approach for cylinder with single degree of freedom (cross flow oscillations) and two degree of freedoms (in-plane oscillations) shows that it is able to capture VIV fundamental characteristics and predict accurately responses of cylinders at various reduced velocities and mass ratios. Numerical prediction is in good agreement with earlier experimental studies for presented benchmark test cases. It shows a great potential of the proposed approach for design and analysis of structures under flow induced vibrations.},

  abstract = {Wake induced vibration is a distinctive phenomena of fluid elastic instability arising from interactions of a body in the wakes of another bluff body and characteristically different from the well-understood vortex induced vibrations. This work presents a fluid-structure interactions numerical model as an alternative tool for investigation of wake induced vibrations. In an attempt to better understand mechanisms of wake induced motions, a simplified model of two cylinders in tandem arrangement with different diameters under cross flow was considered in this work. Cross flow velocity conditions vary from moderate to high Reynolds number (Re=2 x 10(3)-5 x 10(4)) in the same range as many experiment reported recently in literature. A hybrid detached eddy simulation approach is used for turbulence modelling at those high Reynolds number conditions in order to resolve complex near body flow features as well as in the wake regions. The proposed model is first validated through extensive benchmarking with experimental studies for responses of tandem cylinders at the same flow conditions as in physical experiment. With good agreement to experimental data, the model was extended for simulations of cylinders of different diameters in tandem arrangement. For different diameters between upstream and downstream cylinders, the fundamental frequencies of shedded vortices from the cylinders are essentially different. It is observed from the present study that responses of the downstream cylinder are characterized not only the geometrical parameters such as distances and diameter differences between the cylinders but also the Reynolds number. As contrast to many experimental studies, at constant Reynolds number; downstream cylinders are found to have multiple lock-in regions in a wide range of reduced velocities. This distinctive behaviour of the cylinders at constant Reynolds numbers and diameter ratios suggests strong evidence of complicated mechanism of wake-induced vibrations phenomena. Further analysis of results from high fidelity numerical simulations were carried out for detailed investigations of force amplitudes and frequencies. The current analysis revealed multiple frequency content of the force; thus explaining high response amplitudes of the downstream cylinder at high reduced velocity.},

So far the first German offshore wind farm was constructed and put into operation by ``Alpha Ventus''. Experiences illustrate that bad weather conditions are the main cause for delays in transport, handling and installation of offshore wind farms. This can lead to extensive project delays up to several months. The main objective of current logistical research activities is the robust design of planning and control methods for offshore installations. In this study, the basic conditions and existing disturbances of supply chains for offshore installations are analyzed. Based on these results, a planning and control concept will be introduced. Additionally, a mathematical model using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is developed. It calculates the optimal installation schedule for offshore wind farms by observing different weather conditions. The model can be used to reduce vessel operation times in dependence on seasonal or up-to-date weather forecasts.},

These limits are usually based on estimations of various experts and not on real assumptions and measurements on-site. When wind speeds and wave heights are too high, work cannot be carried out, and this leads to delays and additional costs. Therefore, we have carried out a measurement campaign during the installation of rotor blades to investigate to which extent the limits can be adjusted by using a tuned mass damper. The results from the measurement campaign\textemdash specifically empirically derived significant wave height limits\textemdash are used in a discrete event simulation. This study simulates delays resulting from weather conditions. Based on this, the total installation costs are considered. The results of the measurement campaign show that a safe installation with the use of a damper is possible at wave heights of up to 1.6 m. With the discrete event simulation, it is possible to prove that 17.9\% can be saved for the costs of the installation vessel. In addition, the wind farm could be erected 32 days faster. Thus, it can be stated that the use of a tuned mass damper simplifies the installation from a technical point of view and is economical.},

The characteristics of various foundation types (i.e., gravity, pile, suction caisson, and float type) and the current status of field application are discussed. Moreover, the mechanical characteristics of soil are described in the sense that these characteristics including modulus, strength, damping, and modulus degradation of soil play critical roles for the design of offshore foundations. By using these mechanical properties of soil, theoretical studies to consider structure-soil interaction are classified (into equivalent spring models, distributed spring models, and continuous element models) and explained. Field and laboratory experiments on the response of structure embedded in soil to static and dynamic loads are discussed. Based on the review of previous studies, directions for future research and study on offshore wind turbine are suggested.},

  abstract = {A circular cylinder subjected to forced oscillations at angle {$\alpha$} with respect to the free stream shows a number of admissible modes of vortex formation synchronized with the body motion. These modes can be categorized into two basic groups: symmetrical vortex formation; and antisymmetrical vortex formation. Whereas there is a single symmetrical mode, there are four basic antisymmetrical modes. Three of these antisymmetrical modes show period doubling relative to the classical K\'arm\'an mode. This doubling arises from the symmetrical perturbation component induced by the cylinder motion at {$\alpha$} {$\pm$} 90\textdegree. Synchronization, i.e. phase-locking of the vortex shedding with the cylinder motion, is possible for all of these modes. It occurs even when streamwise ({$\alpha$} = 0\textdegree ) motion induces an antisymmetrical mode.When synchronization does not occur, there is competition between the symmetrical and antisymmetrical modes; the near-wake structure successively locks-on to each mode over a defined number of cycles, abruptly switching between modes. The number of occurrences of each mode is a well-defined function of excitation frequency and angle {$\alpha$}.If, in contrast to steady-state motion of the cylinder, there is an initial transient motion, the transition between symmetrical and antisymmetrical modes has a markedly different character, emphasizing the importance of initial conditions. Abrupt onset of sinusoidal motion produces an initially synchronized symmetrical mode, which gradually decays to an antisymmetrical mode. The number of excitation cycles to onset of decay to antisymmetrical mode is highly repeatable. Moreover, the mechanism of decay of the near wake from the symmetrical to antisymmetrical mode can occur deterministically over a defined number of cycles.},

Excitation was at frequency fe, relative to the formation frequency f*0 of large-scale vortices from the corresponding stationary cylinder, and at Reynolds numbers in the range 584 [les ] Re [les ] 1300. Modifications of the near wake were characterized by visualization of the instantaneous flow structure in conjunction with body displacement-flow velocity correlations.At fe/f*0 = {$\frac{1}{2}$}, corresponding to subharmonic excitation, as well as at fe/f*0 = 1, the near wake structure is phase-locked (synchronized) to the cylinder motion. However, the synchronization mechanism is distinctly different in these two regimes. Near or at fe/f*0 = 1, the phase of the shed vortex with respect to the cylinder displacement switches by approximately {$\pi$}. Characteristics of this phase switch are related to cylinder geometry. It does not occur if the cylinder has significant afterbody.Over a wide range of fe/f*0, the perturbed near wake rapidly recovers to a largescale antisymmetrical mode similar in form to the well-known K\'arm\'an vortex street. The mechanisms of small-scale (fe) vortex interaction leading to recovery of the large-scale (f0) vortices are highly ordered and repeatable, though distinctly different, for superharmonic excitation (fe/f*0 = n = 2, 3, 4) and non-harmonic excitation (non-integer values of fe/f*0).The frequency f0 of the recovered vortex street downstream of the body shows substantial departure from the shedding frequency f*0 from the corresponding stationary body. It locks-on to resonant modes corresponding to f0/fe = 1/n. This wake response involves strictly hydrodynamic phenomena. It shows, however, a resonant behaviour analogous to that of coupled flow-acoustic systems where the shear layer is convectively unstable},

In this context, a quite extensive experimental campaign is being performed at the Tocha wind farm, an onshore wind farm located in Portugal, which includes the simultaneous instrumentation of several wind turbines, adopting strain gauges, clinometers and accelerometers distributed in the tower and blades. This paper introduces the Tocha wind farm, presents the different layouts adopted in the instrumentation of the wind turbines and shows some initial results from the already fully instrumented wind turbine. At this preliminary stage, the capabilities of the very extensive monitoring layout are demonstrated. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the ability of the different monitoring components to track the modal parameters of the system composed of a tower and rotor and to characterize the internal loads at the tower base and blade roots.},

Wind turbines in parked conditions can be treated as telecommunication or lighting towers, for which a fair amount of experimental studies is available. However, natural frequencies and damping coefficients may change dramatically in operating conditions. In this case, experimental investigations are quite few and the literature is almost lacking in damping ratio measurements for the vertical axis typology. This paper uses the results of a long-term monitoring campaign over a vertical axis wind turbine to investigate natural frequencies and modal damping coefficients under different wind and operating conditions. After selecting structural acceleration records in different conditions of the wind and of the turbine spin and also considering a non-stationary thunderstorm event, the study describes an extended investigation of the modal parameters, paying special attention to damping ratios and including higher modes.},

Quantitative thresholds related to Scruton number domains, where the structural response can be considered in ``forced vibration'' or ``lock-in'' regime, are proposed. In this way, the type of VIV response and its evaluation can be assessed with simple calculations that use the parameters already present in codes and guidelines. An analytical solution of the original model allows straightforward evaluations inclusive of operative criteria to properly consider structural and flow conditions concerning the coefficients governing the VIV response in the spectral description, leaving out some assumptions that are commonly adopted. Extensive numerical applications, limited here to circular cylinders and including a real full-scale chimney, allow to identify the most significant parameters of the model and the criticalities connected with their choice.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind turbine (OWT) installations are continually expanding as they are considered an efficient mechanism for covering a part of the energy consumption requirements. The assessment of the energy potential of OWTs for specific offshore sites is the key factor that defines their successful implementation, commercialization and sustainability. The data used for this assessment mainly refer to wind speed measurements. However, the data may not present homogeneity due to incomplete or missing entries; this in turn, is attributed to failures of the measuring devices or other factors. This fact may lead to considerable limitations in the OWTs energy potential assessment. This paper presents two novel methodologies to handle the problem of incomplete and missing data. Computational intelligence algorithms are utilized for the filling of the incomplete and missing data in order to build complete wind speed series. Finally, the complete wind speed series are used for assessing the energy potential of an OWT in a specific offshore site. In many real-world metering systems, due to meter failures, incomplete and missing data are frequently observed, leading to the need for robust data handling. The novelty of the paper can be summarized in the following points: (i) a comparison of clustering algorithms for extracting typical wind speed curves is presented for the OWT related literature and (ii) two efficient novel methods for missing and incomplete data are proposed.},

Unscheduled maintenance due to unanticipated failures is the most prominent driver of the maintenance cost which reinforces the drive towards condition-based maintenance. SCADA based condition monitoring is a cost-effective approach where power curve used to assess the performance of a wind turbine. Such power curves are useful in identification of wind turbine abnormal behaviour. IEC standard 61400-12-1 outlines the guidelines for power curve modelling based on binning. However, establishing such a power curve takes considerable time and is far too slow to reflect changes in performance to be used directly for condition monitoring. To address this, data-driven, nonparametric models being used instead. Gaussian Process models and regression trees are commonly used nonlinear, nonparametric models useful in forecasting and prediction applications. In this paper, two nonparametric methods are proposed for power curve modelling. The Gaussian Process treated as the benchmark model, and a comparative analysis was undertaken using a Regression tree model; the advantages and limitations of each model will be outlined. The performance of these regression models is validated using readily available SCADA datasets from a healthy wind turbine operating under normal conditions.},

Therefore a software tool that is capable of predicting the in-situ performance of multiple turbine installations in different operating conditions with reliable accuracy is needed. In present study wind farm layout design tool OffWindSolver is developed within the OpenFoam architecture. Unsteady PisoFoam solver is extended to account for wind turbines, where each turbine is modeled as a sink term in the momentum equation. Turbine modeling is based on actuator line concepts derived from SOWFA code, where each blade of the turbine is represented as a line. The loading on each line/blade of the turbine is estimated using the Blade Element Method (BEM). The inputs for the solver are tabulated airfoil aerodynamic data, dimension and height of the wind turbines, wind magnitude and direction. OffWindSolver is validated for a real wind farm - Lillgrund offshore facility in Sweden/Denmark operated by Vattenfall Vindkraft AB. Because of the scale of the computation, we only examine the effect of wind from one direction at one speed. In the absence of time dependent Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL), a log wind profile with surface roughness of 0.04 is used at the inlet. The simulated power production of each turbine is compared to the field data and large-eddy simulation. The overall power of the wind farm is well predicted. The simulation shows the significant decreases of the power for those turbines that were in the wake.},

  abstract = {The application of structural control to offshore wind turbines (OWTs) using tuned mass dampers (TMDs) has shown to be effective in reducing the system loads. The parameters of a magnetorheological (MR) damper modeled by the Bouc-Wen model are modified to utilize it as a damping device of the TMD. Rather than showcasing the intricate design policy, this research focuses on the availability of the MR damper model on TMDs and its significance on structural control. The impact of passive and semiactive (S-A) TMDs applied to both fixed bottom and floating OWTs is evaluated under the fatigue limit state (FLS) and the ultimate limit state (ULS). Different S-A control logics based on the ground hook (GH) control policy are implemented, and the frequency response of each algorithm is investigated. It is shown that the performance of each algorithm varies according to the load conditions such as a normal operation and an extreme case. Fully coupled time domain simulations are conducted through a newly developed simulation tool, integrated into FASTv8. Compared with the passiveTMD, it is shown that the S-A TMD results in higher load reductions with smaller strokes under both the FLS and the ULS conditions. The S-A TMD using displacement-based GH control is capable of reducing the fore-aft and side-to-side damage equivalent loads for the monopile by approximately 12\% and 64\%, respectively. The ultimate loadings at the tower base for the floating substructure are reduced by 9\% with the S-A TMD followed by inverse velocity-based GH control (IVB-GH).},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of wind turbine tower damping control design and implementation in situations where the support structure parameters vary from their nominal design values. Such situations can, in practice, occur for onshore and especially offshore wind turbines and are attributed to aging, turbine installation, scour or marine sand dunes phenomena and biofouling. Practical experience of wind turbine manufacturing industry has shown that such effects are most easily quantified in terms of the first natural frequency of the turbine support structure. The paper brings forward a study regarding the amount to which nominal tower damping controller performance is affected by changes in the turbine natural frequency. Subsequently, an adaptive tower damping control loop is designed using linear parameter-varying control synthesis; the proposed tower damping controller depends on this varying parameter which is assumed throughout the study to be readily available. An investigation of the fatigue load reduction performance in comparison with the original tower damping control approach is given for a generic three-bladed horizontal-axis wind turbine.

Large-eddy simulations of a low mass ratio (m = 2.6) two-degrees of freedom circular cylinder at the subcritical Reynolds number Re = 5300 and zero damping ( = 0) for several reduced velocities of the system have been performed. A detailed description of the flow topology at the cylinder boundary layer and in the near wake for the three branches of structural response, i.e. the initial (I), super-upper (SU) and lower (L) branches, is presented. In the SU branch, the boundary layer becomes three-dimensional due to the emergence of streamwise vortices which are associated to the onset of a centrifugal instability that occurs twice every cycle. This is the first time a centrifugal instability in a freely vibrating system is reported. The streamwise structures with alternating vorticity, called here Taylor-G\"ortler vortices, are described and characterised. It is shown that their wavelength is in agreement with that of other centrifugal instabilities observed in forced sinusoidal oscillating cylinders.},

In particular uncertainties associated with offshore installations can extend construction schedules and increase the capital expenditure (CAPEX) required for a given project. Installation costs typically account for approximately 30\% of the overall project cost. This study considers the installation modelling for UK offshore Wind Rounds 1 and 2 using probabilistic simulation tool. The tool is used to output time-domain predictions for the completion of key installation phases. By varying key wind farm characteristics such as distance to shore and the number of turbines, an assessment of vessel performance was completed for each round by reviewing recorded durations predicted by the software. The results provide a quantification of installation vessel performance and the associated deviations present a measure of installation risk. It is identified that the Round 1 vessels experience less weather downtime but higher variability and the Round 2 vessels perform more consistently but experience larger delays. The paper provides a structured method to identify and benchmark offshore wind installation risks, to support developers and project planners.},

The results obtained have provided a new insight into the vortex-shedding process. Using time-exposure photography of the motion of aluminium particles, a sequence of instantaneous streamline patterns of the flow behind a cylinder has been obtained. These streamline patterns show that during the starting flow the cavity behind the cylinder is closed. However, once the vortex-shedding process begins, this so-called `closed' cavity becomes open, and instantaneous `alleyways' of fluid are formed which penetrate the cavity. In addition, dye experiments also show how layers of dye and hence vorticity are convected into the cavity behind the cylinder, and how they are eventually squeezed out.},

  abstract = {Experiments were performed to study vortex shedding behind a linearly tapered cylinder. Four cylinders were used, with taper ratios varying from 50:1 to 100:1. The cylinders were each run at four different velocities, adjusted to cover the range of laminar vortex shedding for a non-tapered cylinder. The flow was confirmed to consist of discrete shedding cells, each with a constant frequency. For a centrespan Reynolds number greater than 100, the dimensionless mean cell length was found to be a constant. Individual cell size was found to be roughly self-similar. New shedding cells were created on the ends of the cylinders, or in regions adjacent to areas not shedding. Successful scalings were found for both the cell shedding frequencies and their differences, the modulation frequencies. The modulation frequencies were found to be constant along the cylinder span. The shedding frequency Strouhal number versus Reynolds number curve was found to have a slightly steeper slope than the Strouhal number curve for a non-tapered cylinder. Vortex shedding was found to begin at a local Reynolds number of about 60, regardless of any other factors. End effects were found to be of little importance.The vortex splits, which form the links between shedding cells, were found to be similar in some respects to those found by earlier investigators. Amplitude results suggested that the splits at different spanwise locations are temporally sequenced by an overall flow mechanism, a supposition confirmed by flow visualization. Wavelet analysis results showed that while the behaviour of the shedding frequencies in time was relatively unaffected by changing taper ratio, the behaviour of the modulation frequency in time was greatly affected. Comparisons with other experiments point out the universality of vortex splitting phenomena.},

In a number of site conditions such as extreme and longer period waves, fast installation, and lighter foundations, tripod structures are more advantageous than monopile and jacket structures. In the implemented dynamic coupled analysis, the sub-structural module in FAST was replaced by the X-SEA offshore substructure analysis component. The time-histories of the reaction forces and the turbine loads were then calculated. The results obtained from X-SEA and from FAST were in good agreement. The pile-soil-structure interaction (PSSI) was included for reliable evaluation of OWT structural systems. The superelement concept was introduced to reduce the computational time. Modal, coupled and uncoupled analyses of the NREL 5MW OWT-tripod support structure including PSSI were carried out and the discussions on the natural frequencies, mode shapes and resulted displacements are presented. Compared to the uncoupled models, the physical interaction between the tower and the support structure in the coupled models resulted in smaller responses. Compared to the fixed support structures, i.e., when PSSI is not included, the piled-support structure has lower natural frequencies and larger responses attributed to its actual flexibility. The models using pile superelements are computationally efficient and give results that are identical to the common finite element models.},

  abstract = {PurposeWorkers on offshore wind turbine installations face a variety of physical and psychological challenges. To prevent potentially dangerous situations or incidents, guidelines for the physical aptitude testing of offshore employees in Germany and other European countries have been developed. However, these criteria have not been previously empirically tested for validity. Although an important component of occupational health and safety, such aptitude testing should not lead to the unjustified exclusion of potential employees.MethodsHeart rate (HR) and oxygen consumption ((V) over dotO(2)) measurements of 23 male offshore employees and trainers were taken during typical field activities, within the framework of mandatory training exercises. These were evaluated in relation to the individual maximum values of the subjects, determined by cycle spiroergometry.ResultsFor the training modules, average HR and (V) over dotO(2) values of approximately 40\% and 33-48\% of the maximum values, respectively, were found. Furthermore, 65\% of the participants achieved average HR values that exceeded 30\% of their individual heart rate reserve and 45\% had (V) over dotO(2) values above 35\% of their individual (V) over dotO(2,max).ConclusionOur preliminary results show that offshore work is a form of heavy physical labor, thereby justifying the criteria put forth in the various fitness to work guidelines. We propose that more in-depth investigations should be performed, incorporating task-specific fitness testing as well as higher level aspects of work safety and security, including effective communication skills and teamwork. We also recommend a re-evaluation of the current limits for physical work provided in the literature. The results of such studies could then be applied to other aptitude tests, thereby strengthening the evidence for such measures.},

The studied parameters included the cross-flow amplitude response, the frequency response in the in-line and cross-flow directions and the mean drag coefficient. The effects of different helical strakes heights (h = 0.05 D, 0.10 D and 0.15 D) and pitches (p = 5 D, 10 D, 15 D) were investigated for five different configurations in two- and three-start helical strakes, respectively. The present study has indicated that the strakes pitch changes the occurrence of the lock-in region, but only the three-start p = 10D model can suppress the high mode frequency. Strakes height is one of the important variables in reducing the amplitude responses of a cylinder while the number of helix is the most significant variable in affecting the performance of helical strakes. The less effectiveness of two-start helical strakes is due to the strakes coverage that is inadequate to disrupt the regular vortices efficiently. The most effective helical strake configuration based on the configurations that are examined in the present study is the three-start p = 10 D h = 0.15 D model.},

  abstract = {Vortex-induced vibrations of bluff bodies occur when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure. Of interest is the prediction of the lift and drag forces on the structure given some limited and scattered information on the velocity field. This is an inverse problem that is not straightforward to solve using standard computational fluid dynamics methods, especially since no information is provided for the pressure. An even greater challenge is to infer the lift and drag forces given some dye or smoke visualizations of the flow field. Here we employ deep neural networks that are extended to encode the incompressible Navier\textendash Stokes equations coupled with the structure's dynamic motion equation. In the first case, given scattered data in space\textendash time on the velocity field and the structure's motion, we use four coupled deep neural networks to infer very accurately the structural parameters, the entire time-dependent pressure field (with no prior training data), and reconstruct the velocity vector field and the structure's dynamic motion. In the second case, given scattered data in space\textendash time on a concentration field only, we use five coupled deep neural networks to infer very accurately the vector velocity field and all other quantities of interest as before. This new paradigm of inference in fluid mechanics for coupled multi-physics problems enables velocity and pressure quantification from flow snapshots in small subdomains and can be exploited for flow control applications and also for system identification.},

  abstract = {As part of the energy transition, the French government is planning the construction of three offshore wind farms in Normandy (Bay of Seine and eastern part of the English Channel, north-western France) in the next years. These offshore wind farms will be integrated into an ecosystem already facing multiple anthropogenic disturbances such as maritime transport, fisheries, oyster and mussel farming, and sediment dredging. Currently no integrated, ecosystem-based study on the effects of the construction and exploitation of offshore wind farms exists, where biological approaches generally focused on the conservation of some valuable species or groups of species. Complementary trophic web modelling tools were applied to the Bay of Seine ecosystem (to the 50 km(2) area covered by the wind farm) to analyse the potential impacts of benthos and fish aggregation caused by the introduction of additional hard substrates from the piles and the turbine scour protections. An Ecopath ecosystem model composed of 37 compartments, from phytoplankton to seabirds, was built to describe the situation "before" the construction of the wind farm. Then, an Ecosim projection over 30 years was performed after increasing the biomass of targeted benthic and fish compartments. Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) indices were calculated for the two periods, "before" and "after", to compare network functioning and the overall structural properties of the food web. Our main results showed (1) that the total ecosystem activity, the overall system omnivory (proportion of generalist feeders), and the recycling increased after the construction of the wind farm; (2) that higher trophic levels such as piscivorous fish species, marine mammals, and seabirds responded positively to the aggregation of biomass on piles and turbine scour protections; and (3) a change in keystone groups after the construction towards more structuring and dominant compartments. Nonetheless, these changes could be considered as limited impacts of the wind farm installation on this coastal trophic web structure and functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The objectives are to improve installation efficiency and ensure operational safety. A simplified three-dimensional crane-wire-blade model is adopted to design the optimal control algorithm. A crane winch servo motor is controlled by the NMPC controller. The direct multiple shooting approach is applied to solve the nonlinear programming problem. High-fidelity simulations of the lifting operations are implemented based on a turbulent wind field with the MarIn and CaSADi toolkit in MATLAB. By well-tuned weighting matrices, the NMPC controller is capable of preventing snap loads and axial peak tension, while ensuring efficient lifting operation.

  abstract = {In an offshore environment, offshore wind energy resources are more available and stable, but the investment cost is much higher than that of onshore wind. The installation cost is a crucial factor of the investment. With the increasing number of planned and approved offshore wind farms, offshore wind turbine installation and relevant operations have received tremendous attention. Therefore, expediting the turbine-structure mating operations through a higher level of automation in offshore wind turbine installations may provide important economic benefits. To achieve a higher automation level and reduce the weather waiting time during the installation of offshore wind turbines, a flexible simulation-verification framework with high fidelity is needed. However, stateof-the-art wind turbine numerical analysis code is neither convenient nor open enough for applications concerning the design and verification of control algorithms. MATLAB/Simulink is among the most widely utilized numerical platforms by control engineers and researchers. This paper describes the development of a modularized blade installation simulation toolbox for the purpose of control design in MATLAB/Simulink. The toolbox can be used to simulate several blade installation configurations, both onshore and offshore. The paper presents the key features and equations of the different modules, exemplified by a single blade installation operation. Code-to-code verification results are presented and discussed with both quasi-steady wind and threedimensional turbulent wind field.},

Rational-exponent Lyapunov functions (ReLFs) are employed in the backstepping design, and the Bernoulli inequality is primarily adopted in the stability proof. Semiglobal practical finite-time stability, or global asymptotically stability, is guaranteed by a continuous control law using a commonly used recursive backstepping-like approach. Unlike the inductive design of typical finite-time backstepping controllers, the proposed method has the advantage of reduced design complexity. The virtual control laws are designed by directly canceling the nonlinear terms in the derivative of the specific Lyapunov functions. The terms with exponents are transformed into linear forms as their bases. The stability proof is simplified by applying several inequalities in the final proof, instead of in each step. Furthermore, the singularity problem no longer exists. The weakness of the concept of practical finite-time stability is discussed. The method can be applied to smoothly extend numerous design methodologies with asymptotic stability with a higher convergence rate near the equilibrium. Two numerical case studies are provided to present the performance of the proposed control.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind turbines (OWTs) have become increasingly popular for their ability to harvest clean offshore wind energy. Bottom-fixed foundations are the most used foundation type. Because of its large diameter, the foundation is sensitive to wave loads. For typical manually assisted blade-mating operations, the decision to perform the mating operation is based on the relative distance and velocity between the blade root center and the hub, and in accordance with the weather window. Hence, monitoring the hub real-time position and velocity is necessary, whether the blade installation is conducted manually or automatically. In this study, we design a hub motion estimation algorithm for the OWT with a bottom-fixed foundation using sensor fusion of a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Two schemes are proposed based on a moving horizon estimator, a multirate Kalman filter, an online smoother, and a predictor. The moving horizon estimator mitigates the slow GNSS sampling rate relative to the hub dynamics. The multirate Kalman filter estimates the position, velocity, and accelerometer bias with a constant GNSS measurement delay. The online smoothing algorithm filters the delayed estimated trajectory to remove sudden step changes. The predictor compensates the delayed estimate, resulting in real-time monitoring. HAWC2 and MATLAB are used to verify the performance of the estimation algorithms, showing that a sufficiently accurate real-time position and velocity estimate with a high sampling rate is achieved. A sensitivity study compares the accuracy of different algorithms applied in various conditions. By combining both proposed algorithms, a sufficiently accurate estimation can be achieved for a wider scope of practical applications.},

Guidelines and standards for health and safety in lifting operations exist; however, having people directly beneath the load is still common practice in offshore wind turbine installations. Concepts for human-free offshore lifting operations in the categories of guidance and control, connections, and assembly are studied in this work. This paper documents the process of applying Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), using experts' opinions for the importance of defined criteria obtained by conducting an industry survey, to benchmark the suitability of the concepts at two stages. Stage one streamlined possible options and stage two ranked the remaining suite of options after further development. The survey results showed that criteria such as 'reduction of risk', 'handling improvement' and 'reliability of operation' were most important. The most viable options, weighted by industry opinion, to remove personnel from areas of high risk are: Boom Lock and tag lines, a camera system with mechanical guidance, and automated bolt installation/fastening for seafastening. The decision analysis framework developed can be applied to similar problems to inform choices subject to multiple criteria.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Generally, the model-based installation planning of offshore wind farms knows two approaches: event-discrete simulations and mathematical optimizations. Both provide advantages in terms of computational time, detail and optimality. This article aims to identify common structural elements in the descriptions of both approaches, enabling the application of model transformations. Methodology: Therefore, several models of both types will be compared, combining relevant concepts, i.e., entities, attributes and relationships into a generalized model. In a second step, elements crucial to either type of model are identified. For the remaining elements, interdependencies and redundancies will be identified to enable a model reduction. Findings: While the structure and notation of both approaches are different, both describe the same fundamental concepts and relationships. The article provides a data model of these common concepts for the operational planning of offshore activities, including weather restrictions and forecasts. Originality: In current literature, there exist no approaches to combine mathematical optimization with event-discrete simulations in the context of offshore wind farm installations. To harness the advantages of both approaches in an integrated methodology, a model of common concepts is required, which does not exist at this time. Limitations: While the current model is limited to the operations planning for the installation ; it provides a foundation for future extensions to cover additional planning problems in this context, e.g., the capacity planning for vessels and storage spaces.},

  abstract = {A verification and validation study was performed using the open source computational fluid dynamics solver OpenFOAM version 2.0.0 for incompressible bluff body fluid flows. This includes flow over a backward facing step, a sphere in the subcritical regime, and delta wing with sharp leading edge. The study investigates solver scalability, and accuracy of numerical methods and turbulence models available in the solver. Grid verification study shows mostly monotonic convergence with averaged grid uncertainty {$<$}5\% for integral quantities and up to 10\% for local variables. The solver shows good strong scalability up to 192 processors on a mesh with 11M cells. The study identifies that the 2nd order linear upwind scheme is most efficient and accurate for Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations, while the 1st/2nd order blended limited linear scheme is best for simulations employing hybrid RANS/Large Eddy Simulation (HRL). PIMPLE and SIMPLE pressure\textendash velocity coupling methods are identified to be best for HRL and RANS simulations, respectively. The validation study showed that drag and mean velocity predictions compared within 5\% of the experimental data, whereas larger errors were predicted for turbulent kinetic energy and instability frequency predictions. OpenFOAM predictions compared within 6\% of FLUENT results for backward facing step and sphere cases, and performed better than the latter for the delta wing vortex breakdown predictions. Overall, OpenFOAM is found to be a reliable research solver; however, it is more sensitivity to grid quality than FLUENT, which needs to be further investigated.},

Currently, several floating turbine concepts are being designed and tested in small scale projects; in particular, one concept allows the turbine to move after installation. This article presents a novel layout optimization framework for wind farms composed of moveable floating turbines. The proposed framework uses an evolutionary optimization strategy in a nested configuration which simultaneously optimizes the anchoring locations and the wind turbine position within the mooring lines for each individual wind direction. The results show that maximum energy production is obtained when moveable wind turbines are deployed in an optimized layout. In conclusion, the framework represents a new design optimization tool for future offshore wind farms composed of moveable floating turbines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {, The vortex-induced vibration of a spring-mounted, damped, rigid circular cylinder, immersed in a Newtonian viscous flow and capable of moving in the direction orthogonal to the unperturbed flow is investigated for Reynolds numbers  ReRe  in the vicinity of the onset of unsteadiness ( 15{$\leqslant$}Re{$\leqslant$}6015\textbackslash leqslant Re\textbackslash leqslant 60 ) using the incompressible linearised Navier\textendash Stokes equations. In a first step, we solve the linear problem considering an imposed harmonic motion of the cylinder. Results are interpreted in terms of the mechanical impedance, i.e.~the ratio between the vertical force coefficient and the cylinder velocity, which is represented as function of the Reynolds number and the driving frequency. Considering the energy transfer between the cylinder and the fluid, we show that impedance results provide a simple criterion allowing the prediction of the onset of instability of the coupled fluid-elastic structure case. A global stability analysis of the fully coupled fluid/cylinder system is then performed. The instability thresholds obtained by this second approach are found to be in perfect agreement with the predictions of the impedance-based criterion. A theoretical argument, based on asymptotic developments, is then provided to give a prediction of eigenvalues of the coupled problem, as well as to characterise the region of instability beyond the threshold as function of the reduced velocity  U{${_\ast}$}U\^\{\textbackslash ast \} , the dimensionless mass  m{${_\ast}$}m\^\{\textbackslash ast \}  and the Reynolds number. The influence of the damping parameter  {$\mathsl{\gamma}\mathsl{\gamma}\backslash$}unicode[STIX]\{x1D6FE\}  on the instability region is also explored.},

  abstract = {One of the major concern of wind farm offshore is the type of wind turbine foundation to be installed. When it comes to talk about offshore installation of pre-piled fixed jacket foundations (3-4 legs), one of the most critical activities to be performed by the installer is the grouting operation. For currently wind turbines size, pre-piling jacket installation is a very extended alternative used which are drilled into the seabed until only 4-5 m come out the seabed line. Once piles have been installed into the seabed it comes the time to proceed with jacket legs installation. Next step is to grouting-secured together both structures (pile and jacket) pouring grout, throughout the already pre-installed grouting lines into the lower part of the jacket leg. Due to complexity of the overall manoeuvre as well as required precision not only for the grout system but for the right parameters should be considered for pouring in order to ensure the grout correctly into the pile/jacket annulus without segregation or other undesirable effects occurring a mockup test was carried out. The proposed and analysed method defines a protocol that could be used and repeated for others offshore windfarms that are planned to be installed in the future over pre-pilled foundations. Running a grout wall test based on protocol described on this paper prior to offshore grout operations will guarantee mix of grout and lub is in line with grouting foundations requirements, saving pumping grout time and therefore vessel stand by costs as well as money savings for grout exceeds, avoiding segregation problems could lead up to in worst case to foundations removal with massive vessel standby costs for reparation of the entire installation foundation operation.},

This contribution presents the results of a monitoring campaign conducted during the installation of an offshore wind park in the North Sea. The campaign covered different states of the turbines: without rotor blades, with rotor blades, without supplementary damping system and with an installed, tuned mass damper system. The objective of the campaign was to determine the dynamic behaviour of the turbines in correlation with wind and wave data and to determine modal parameters. Accordingly, the turbines have been instrumented with sensors to record accelerations at three different positions. The modal parameters were then obtained using SSI/FDD algorithms. Structural damping is additionally determined with an RDM algorithm, and the results are being compared. The analysis of the data will be presented, including the different stages of the structural damping and the corresponding changes in movement patterns. The results shall be used to verify the load models and the predicted response of the structure.},

  abstract = {Overview This repository contains~data from an offshore measurement campaign conducted during the installation of the offshore wind farm trianel wind farm borkum II (https://www.trianel-borkumzwei.de/). The wind farm consists of 32 Senvion 6XM152 turbines. The installation took place between August 2019 and May 2020. An offshore wind turbine undergoing installation is interesting from a research point of view for several reasons: Simple geometry: turbine foundation and tower are both rotationally symmetric steel tubes. Rotational symmetry also leads to (approximate) isotrope structural characteristics in the plane normal to tower and foundation. High Reynolds number flow: Assuming a tower diameter of 6 m, and average wind speeds ranging from 5 m/s to 12 m/s under installation conditions, Reynolds numbers range from 4.5 million to 10.5 million. Wave loading und full scale conditions. Practical relevance to improving the competability of offshore wind. For fluid mechanics, closely monitoring offshore wind turbines under wind and wave loading thus compares to a full scale experiment. Monitoring 32 turbines undergoing installation thus enables the measurement a broad spectrum of different states. The investigation into the data is~ongoing, questions and contributions are welcome. The current data release still does not include all data. The dataset will thus be updated again in the future with more data to come.~First analytic results can be found here: Sander, A, Haselsteiner, AF, Barat, K, Janssen, M, Oelker, S, Ohlendorf, J, \& Thoben, K.

November 23-26, 2020. {$<$}https://generalconferencefiles.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eurodyn\_2020\_ebook\_procedings\_vol1.pdf{$>$} Physical Background An offshore wind turbine under installation conditions can be simplified as a cantlivered beam (circular cross section, rotationally symmetric wall thickness) with an eccentric mass~(nacelle with generator) vibrating transversally (fore-aft and side-side in the reference system of the nacelle) under wind and wave loads. Both wind and wave loads are stochastic and are described using statistical models. Wave loads are a function of the sea state. For a sea states, the most important parameters are significant wave heigh H\_m0 and Wave peak period T\_P. To a lesser extend, wave direction, zero upcrossing period and maximum wave height are also important. Different statistical models can be used to describe the sea state and the relationship between significant wave heigh H\_m0 and wave peak period. Most prominent in the North Sea is the JONSWAP spectrum. Wind loads are depending on wind speed, wind direction, shear factor and turbulence intensity. Different statistical models are available to describe the wind spectrum. Wind and wave loads trigger a structural response of the turbine. The structural response depends on the loading spectrum as well as the transfer function. Furthermore the structural response is strongly depending on damping and elasticity of the structure. In turbines, damping is typically very low (\textasciitilde{} 0.5 - 1.5 \%). The response is dominated by the first Eigenfrequency of the turbine. As the turbine is assumed to be rotationally symmetric, the fore-aft and side-side mode are extremely close together if not indistinguishable [1]. The response has the characteristics of a narrow-band random vibration. A narrow-band random vibration is characterized by being dominated by a single, narrow frequency peak (here: first Eigenfrequency). The amplitude envelope follows a Rayleigh distribution and the phase angle is equally distributed between 0 and 2 pi. If viewed from above, the structural response describes a closed curve (orbit) which can be characterized by it shape (eccentricity), mean amplitude and direction. Mathematically speaking, this is a lissajous-figure, where the time series from one response direction is plotted as a function of the time series of the second response direction. [1]: under installation condition Experimental Setup Several locations were used to record data during the installation of the wind farm. They are listed in the following table: helihoist-\{1,2\}:~data recorded from the helicopter hoisting platform atop the turbine nacelle. For most installations, two sensor boxes were deployed to ensure data availability. tp:~Measurements from the transition piece sbitroot:~Measurements from the blade lifting yoke's blade root side. The Z-axis is aligned to the blade main axis, X-Axis is perpendicular. sbittip:~Measurements from the tip side of the blade lifting yoke. Z-axis aligned with the blade main axis, X-axis perpendicular damper:~Measurements from the tuned mass damper used during single blade installation towertop:~measurements from inside the turbine tower at the upper lift plattform towertransfer: measurements from atop the towers during sail out from the base harbour to the installation site~ Organization of data For each turbine installation, a separate folder can be found, e.g. turbine-01 for the first and turbine-16 for the 16th turbine. Turbine numbering follows the order of installation. Different data sources are organized in subfolders for each turbine dataset. Unfortunately, not every data source is available for each turbine. Data sources are roughly sorted into categories. The following table lists these categories: location / tom : data from custom build sensor boxes. Data includes acceleration, angular acceleration, magnetic field, gnss recording and rough estimates of the eulerian angles. waves / wmb-sued :~Sea state statistics for the installatin period of the turbine. waves / fino :~Sea state statistics from the german research platform FINO1~located approx. 6 km from the installation site. waves / waveradar :~Sea state statstics, recorded by a wave rider wave laser.~ wind / lidar :~high fidelity wind data recorded on the installation vessel during the installation of the wind farm. wind / scada :~10 min. mean wind statistisc recorded on wind turbines in the vicinity of the installation site. This data is used in case no LIDAR data is available. wind / anemometer :~During some of the installations, anemometers were present on the installation vessel. These recordings are sorted into this sub-subfolder. wind / fino :~Additonal wind statistics recorded by the FINO research station. Least recommended for investigations, as these recordings were taken approx. 6 km from the installation site. The zenodo data set includes 16 zip archives (for 16 turbines) as well as one zip archive including environmental data.

These Sensor Boxes were initially designed to measure accelerations and GPS tracks of offshore wind turbine towers undergoing installation. During the installation of the wind farm Trianel Windpark Borkum II they were subsequentially used to track the complete installation with a focus on single blade installation Data from the TOM devices comes as CSV files. The firmware of the boxes was designed, such that data was written into 10 MB sized txt files instead of one large txt file in order to circumvent data corruption due to power loss. However, this leads to a few milliseconds of missing data between log files. Additionally, jitter due to IO-Operations is present in the data as well and data should under all circumstance be resampled befor further analysis. Parameters provided by the TOM devices are listed in the following: epoch :~machine readable time stamp based on the unix epoch in UTC [s]~ runtime : time since last boot of the tom device [ms]~ latitude : Degrees latitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due North]~ longitude :~Degrees longitude in decimal writing. For Trianel: [degree due East]~ elevation :~elevation above mean sea level [m]~ rot\_\{x,y,z\} :~Rotational acceleration around the three cartesian axis \{x,y,z\} of the TOM box. [degree / s\^2]~ acc\_\{x,y,z\} :~linear acceleration in each of the three cartesian axis \{x,y,z\} in the reference system of the TOM box [m/s\^2]~ mag\_\{x,y,z\} :~magnetic field strength in each of the local cartesian TOM box axis \{x,y,z\} [micro-Tesla]~ roll :~eulerian roll angle (angle around the x Axis of the tom box) [degree]~ pitch :~eulerian pitch angle (angle around the y Axis of the tom box) [degree]~ yaw :~eulerian yaw angle (angle around the z Axis of the tom box) [degree]~ LIDAR wind data description A Leosphere WindCube LIDAR was mounted on the installation vessel Taillevent~to record the atmospheric boundary layer during installation.~The data recorded by the lidar was exported as csvs and provided by the vessel operator. The raw data includes the following parameters epoch :~time stamp as a unix epoch in UTC [s] wind\_speed\_N :~The wind speed at the N'th return level [m/s] wind\_dir\_N :~Wind direction at the N'th return level in the vessels reference frame [degree] wind\_dir\_N\_corr :~Wind direction at the N'th return level due North [degree due North] heigh\_N :~The height of the lidar return level [m]~ Data is resampled to a 1 s return interval.~ wave data description Wave data was recorded using a waverider wave buoy (DWR-G). The wave rider buoy was located at 54 00' 238'' degree North and 6 26' 553'' degree East. In decimals: 54.0031096 North, 6.4425532 East.~Based on the raw data, sea state statistics were derived with a return period of 30 minutes. The data comes as csv, column oriented text files. The first line entails parameter names and units and is commented out by a hashbang (unix commentary). The data is a combination of two different data files as provided by the buoy: \textbackslash *.HIS Data Text File (History of Spectrum parameters) and \textbackslash *.HIW Data Text File (History of Wave Statistics). This results in the two timestamps in the data file because history of wave statistics data is available immediately after each measurement time period, whereas history of spectrum parameters take approx. 5 minutes to calculate by the buoy and thus have a slightly later time stamp.

In this research a method is presented to reduce the azimuthal orientation error of wind direction sensors by means of Doppler Lidar measurements. The method is based on the comparison between the conventional sensor and a distant long range lidar pointing to it in staring mode. By comparing their line-of-sight wind speeds any misalignment between both systems can be estimated more accurately. This method was applied in an measurement campaign in the offshore wind farm alpha ventus next to the meteorological mast FINO1. The maximum alignment error of a Sonic was reduced to below +/- 1 degrees. This accurate alignment has asserted, that no bias exists between Lidar and Sonic wind speed measurements.},

One such design is the usage of tubercles in either leading or trailing edge of airfoils. So the usage of tubercles has so far been in the design of wing or wind-turbines. Recent studies have aimed to study tubercles for the design of a propeller. The studies have so far gained reputations in improving the aerodynamic performance on a few but not all of the airfoil shapes. Similar results have been identified for propeller designs with improvement in thrust at low torque. We have so far led research works on developing new propeller designs with the aim to improve the thrust and torque performance of propeller. A review of recent studies has been performed to study the state-of-the-art. The results of this work will be discussed in this paper.},

An alternative to the traditional joint is a steel-to-steel connection also called a slip joint. To ensure a proper fit of the slip joint a dynamic installation of the joint is proposed. In this contribution, the effectiveness of harmonic excitation as an installation procedure is experimentally investigated using a 1:10 scaled model of the joint. During the dynamic installation test the applied static load, settlements and dynamic response of the joint are monitored using respectively load cells, taut wires and strain gauges placed both inside and outside the conical surfaces. The results show that settlement occurs only when applying a harmonic load at specific forcing frequencies. The settlement stabilizes to a certain level for each of the specific frequencies, indicating that a controlled way of installation is possible. The results show that it is essential to vibrate at specific frequencies and that a larger amplitude of the harmonic force does not automatically lead to additional settlement.},

  abstract = {To make the installation of offshore wind turbines more profitable, installation costs must be minimized. This can be achieved, among other things, by reducing installation times. This work aims to establish correlations between prevailing environmental conditions and rotor blade installation to subsequently make predictions for future installation projects. Furthermore, it is investigated to what extent the use of a vibration damper changes the installation frequency in a year. For this purpose, worldwide data measurements from 2007-2017 are examined. Using the programming language "R", time windows are filtered out that have installationfriendly wind speeds and wave heights. Finally, the filtered datasets are examined for contiguous times that reflect the respective installation times required with and without vibration dampeners. It can be shown that the use of a vibration damper noticeably increases the number of possible installation windows. The probability of a successful installation is lowest in January and highest in June. Filtering wave height and wind speed reduce the number of installation windows. The elaboration offers future work the opportunity to build on the results and use them further to make sense of the analysis of past installation projects using environmental data forecasting.},

While the currently largest offshore wind turbine (the REpower 6M) has a rotor diameter of 126m, this will increase to 150m or even larger in the coming years. This has some implications on the support structures, primarily due to increased lever arm to hub height and increased swept area. Nevertheless, it can be shown that the impact on support structures is limited, as other factors (like wave loading) are of equal importance. With capacities for monopile fabrication increasing, it appears that even 40m water depth is feasible, provided that stiff soil conditions are present. Another interesting finding is that tower head mass does not influence substructure masses as much as thought so far. It can be shown that smaller head masses can even lead to increased substructure weights, depending on site conditions.},

While commercial software is available that allows for integrated wind/wave analysis for a Monopile foundation, programs which accomplish this task for complex structures are currently not available. While the widely used Monopile is still an option for the REpower 5M with 126m rotor diameter, investigations regarding different substructures to develop the most cost efficient solution were conducted. This lead to the development of ``semi-integrated'' calculation methods for complex substructures which employ specialized programs from the Wind industry and the Offshore industry to combine these into a comprehensive load calculation package. Two different superposition approaches are explained and illustrated by an example which shows that excellent agreement compared to integrated analysis can be achieved.},

In order to produce renewable hydrogen, the power is locally generated by wind turbines and wave energy converters and fully used by the electrolyzers. The energy generated at the platform by wind and wave is balanced by regulating the operating point of each electrolysis unit and its connections or disconnections, using an MPC based on a Mixed-Integer-Quadratic-Programming algorithm. This Predictive Control algorithm makes it possible to take into account predictions of available power and power consumption, to improve the balance and reduce the number of connections and disconnections of the devices. Two case studies are carried out on different installations composed of wave and wind energies feeding a set of alkaline electrolyzers. Validation using measured data at the target location of the platforms shows the adequate operation of the proposed EMS. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Life cycle cost (LCC) considerations are of increasing importance to offshore wind farm operators and their insurers to undertake long-term profitable investments and to make electricity generation more price-competitive. This paper presents a cost breakdown structure (CBS) and develops a whole life cost (WLC) analysis framework for offshore wind farms throughout their life span (similar to 25 years). A combined multivariate regression/neural network approach is developed to identify key cost drivers and evaluate all the costs associated with five phases of offshore wind projects, namely pre-development and consenting (P\&C), production and acquisition (P\&A), installation and commissioning (I\&C), operation and maintenance (O\&M) and decommissioning and disposal (D\&D). Several critical factors such as geographical location and meteorological conditions, rated power and capacity factor of wind turbines, reliability of sub-systems and availability and accessibility of transportation means are taken into account in cost calculations. The O\&M costs (including the cost of renewal and replacement, cost of lost production, cost of skilled maintenance labour and logistics cost) are assessed using the data available in failure databases (e.g. fault logs and O\&M reports) and the data supplied by inspection agencies. A net present value (NPV) approach is used to quantify the current value of future cash flows, and then, a bottom-up estimate of the overall cost is obtained. The proposed model is tested on an offshore 500-MW baseline wind farm project, and the results are compared to experimental ones reported in the literature. Our results indicate that the capital cost of wind turbines and their installation costs account for the largest proportion of WLC, followed by the O\&M costs. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to identify those factors having the greatest impact on levelized cost of energy (LCOE). The installed capacity of a wind farm, distance from shore and fault detection capability of the condition monitoring system are identified as parameters with significant influence on LCOE. Since the service lifetime of a wind farm is relatively long, a small change in interest rate leads to a large variation in the project's total cost. The presented models not only assist stakeholders in evaluating the performance of ongoing projects but also help the wind farm developers reduce their costs in the medium-long term.},

By comparison, investments in offshore wind have been minor, limited until recently largely by perceptions of cost. Assimilated meteorological data are used here to assess future offshore wind potential for China. Analysis on a provincial basis indicates that the aggregate potential wind resource is 5.4 times larger than the current coastal demand for power. Recent experiences with markets in both Europe and the United States suggest that potential offshore resources in China could be exploited to cost-competitively provide 1148.3 TWh of energy in a high-cost scenario, 6383.4 TWh in a low-cost option, equivalent to between 36 and 200\% of the total coastal energy demand after 2020. The analysis underscores notable benefits for offshore wind for China, with prospects for major reductions in greenhouse emissions with ancillary benefits for air quality. China can use the latest offshore wind technologies to cost-competitively supply a notable portion of its energy demand.

  abstract = {Detached-eddy simulation (DES) was first proposed in 1997 and first used in 1999, so its full history can be surveyed. A DES community has formed, with adepts and critics, as well as new branches. The initial motivation of high\textendash Reynolds number, massively separated flows remains, for which DES is convincingly more capable presently than either unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulation (LES). This review discusses compelling examples, noting the visual and quantitative success of DES. Its principal weakness is its response to ambiguous grids, in which the wall-parallel grid spacing is of the order of the boundary-layer thickness. In some situations, DES on a given grid is then less accurate than RANS on the same grid or DES on a coarser grid. Partial remedies have been found, yet dealing with thickening boundary layers and shallow separation bubbles is a central challenge. The nonmonotonic response of DES to grid refinement is disturbing to most observers, as is the absence of a theoretical order of accuracy. These issues also affect LES in any nontrivial flow. This review also covers the numerical needs of DES, gridding practices, coupling with different RANS models, derivative uses such as wall modeling in LES, and extensions such as zonal DES and delayed DES.},

According to Fourier analysis, any physical signal can be decomposed into a number of discrete frequencies, or a spectrum of frequencies over a continuous range. The statistical average of a certain signal or sort of signal (including noise) as analyzed in terms of its frequency content, is called its spectrum. When the energy of the signal is concentrated around a finite time interval, especially if its total energy is finite, one may compute the energy spectral density. More commonly used is the power spectral density (or simply power spectrum), which applies to signals existing over all time, or over a time period large enough (especially in relation to the duration of a measurement) that it could as well have been over an infinite time interval. The power spectral density (PSD) then refers to the spectral energy distribution that would be found per unit time, since the total energy of such a signal over all time would generally be infinite. Summation or integration of the spectral components yields the total power (for a physical process) or variance (in a statistical process), identical to what would be obtained by integrating                                    x                        2                             (         t         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle x\^\{2\}(t)\}    over the time domain, as dictated by Parseval's theorem.The spectrum of a physical process                         x         (         t         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle x(t)\}    often contains essential  information about the nature of                         x                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle x\}   . For instance, the pitch and timbre of a musical instrument are immediately determined from a spectral analysis. The color of a light source is determined by the spectrum of the electromagnetic wave's electric field                         E         (         t         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle E(t)\}    as it fluctuates at an extremely high frequency. Obtaining a spectrum from time series such as these involves the Fourier transform, and generalizations based on Fourier analysis. In many cases the time domain is not specifically employed in practice, such as when a dispersive prism is used to obtain a spectrum of light in a spectrograph, or when a sound is perceived through its effect on the auditory receptors of the inner ear, each of which is sensitive to a particular frequency. However this article concentrates on situations in which the time series is known (at least in a statistical sense) or directly measured (such as by a microphone sampled by a computer). The power spectrum is important in statistical signal processing and in the statistical study of stochastic processes, as well as in many other branches of physics and engineering. Typically the process is a function of time, but one can similarly discuss data in the spatial domain being decomposed in terms of spatial frequency.},

This paper explains the methodology for optimized designing of ECS. The proposed methodology is based on combined elitist ant colony optimization and multiple travelling salesman problem. The objective is to minimize the length of submarine cable connected between WTs and to minimize the wake loss in the wind farm in order to reduce the cost of cable and cable power loss. The methodology is applied on North Hoyle and Horns Rev OSWFs connected with 30 and 80 WTs respectively and the results are presented.},

  abstract = {The frequencies of vortex shedding from circular cylinders forced to oscillate transversely in low-turbulence uniform and shear flows were investigated. The stream velocity in the shear flow varied linearly with spanwise distance.In both flows the vortex shedding frequency locked on to the cylinder frequency and to submultiples of the cylinder frequency. In uniform flow the range of cylinder frequencies for locking-on was dependent on the amplitude of oscillation and Reynolds number. At the boundaries of locking-on at the cylinder frequency locked-on shedding was intermittent with unforced shedding and locking-on was accompanied by a change in wake width. At a particular cylinder frequency near mid-range it is conjectured that the wake width jumped from being greater to being less than that for the stationary cylinder. In shear flow the spanwise extent of locking-on at the cylinder frequency was explained by considering the uniform flow results and the inclination of shed vortices in shear flow. At the spanwise boundaries of this locking-on, locked-on cells were shed intermittently with unforced cells which were more stable in frequency than the corresponding cells for the stationary cylinder.},

Hence, for wind energy to make considerable contributions to the world's overall energy supply, large wind farms (on- and offshore) consisting of arrays of ever larger wind turbines are being envisioned and built. From a fluid mechanics perspective, wind farms encompass turbulent flow phenomena occurring at many spatial and temporal scales. Of particular interest to understanding mean power extraction and fluctuations in wind farms are the scales ranging from 1 to 10 m that comprise the wakes behind individual wind turbines, to motions reaching 100 m to kilometers in scale, inherently associated with the atmospheric boundary layer. In this review, we summarize current understanding of these flow phenomena (particularly mean and second-order statistics) through field studies, wind tunnel experiments, large-eddy simulations, and analytical modeling, emphasizing the most relevant features for wind farm design and operation.},

Both fixed-bottom and floating substructures are considered in this paper, which will investigate a fixed-bottom monopile as well as a barge, spar buoy, and tension-leg platform for the floating platforms. A set of optimum passive tuned mass dampers are developed by creating a limited degree-of-freedom model for each of the four offshore wind platforms. These models are then integrated into an optimization function using a genetic algorithm to find a globally optimum design for the tuned mass damper. The tuned mass damper parameters determined by the optimization are applied to a series of wind turbine design code simulations using FAST. A sensitivity analysis of the tuned mass damper parameters and a study on the effect of misaligned wind and waves on load reductions are also conducted. Results from these simulations are presented, and tower fatigue damage reductions of up to 20\% are achieved for the various tuned mass damper configurations.},

  abstract = {Vortex `shedding' behind circular cylinders can be altered and suppressed altogether (or `controlled') over a limited range of Reynolds numbers, by a proper placement of a second, much smaller, cylinder in the near wake of the main cylinder. This new and dramatic suppression of vortex `shedding' is the subject of this paper. Details of the phenomenon are documented through parallel experimental and numerical investigations, including flow visualization. Temporal growth rate measurements of the velocity fluctuations reveal that the presence of the smaller cylinder reduces the growth rate of the disturbances leading to vortex `shedding', and that its suppression, accompanied by the disappearance of sharp spectral peaks, coincides with negative temporal growth rates. It is argued that the presence of the secondary cylinder has the effect of altering the local stability of the flow by smearing and diffusing concentrated vorticity in the shear layers behind the body; a related effect is that the secondary cylinder diverts a small amount of fluid into the wake of the main cylinder. A unified explanation of the formation and suppression of the vortex street is attempted, and it is suggested that the vortex `shedding' is associated with temporally unstable eigenmodes which are heavily weighted by the near field. It is also shown that absolute instability is relevant, up to a point, in explaining vortex shedding, whose suppression can similarly be associated with altering the instability in the near wake region from absolute to convective.},

Here, the cylinders were attached to a structural test rig, which would allow them to oscillate in the cross-flow direction only. The oscillation amplitude and frequency data were collected. Accordingly, the results revealed that in the case of the two bare cylinders, the amplitude response of the upstream cylinder was higher compared to the case of single cylinder usage. Furthermore, outcomes obtained confirmed that the helical strakes successfully reduced the oscillation amplitude for the upstream and downstream cylinders both, whereas they were ineffective if merely applied at the downstream cylinder. Hence, it can be concluded that the arrangement of the strakes influences the VIV suppression in the context of two-cylinder cases.},

The present paper proposes a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3d-PTMD) to mitigate the tower and nacelle dynamic response in the fore-aft and side-side directions. An analytical model of the wind turbine coupled with the 3d-PTMD is established wherein the interaction between the blades, the tower and the 3d-PTMD is modeled.

Via a numerical search approach, the design formula of the 3d-PTMD is obtained and examined on a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine model under misaligned wind, wave and seismic loading. Dual linear tuned mass dampers (TMDs) deployed in the fore-aft and side-side directions are utilized for comparison. It is found that the 3d-PTMD with a mass ratio of 2\% can improve the mitigation of the root mean square and peak response by around 10\% when compared with the dual linear TMDs in controlling the bi-directional vibration of the offshore wind turbines under misaligned wind, wave and seismic loading.},

In this paper, a three-dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3d-PTMD) is attached to the OWT to mitigate the bi-directional vibrations resulting from wind-wave misalignment so as to increase the fatigue life. An analytical model of the offshore wind turbine coupled with the 3dPTMD is established using the Euler-Lagrangian equation. To predict long-term metocean condition, a statistical analysis for different properties of wind and wave loading such as, windwave misalignment, significant wave height and wind velocity is carried out. The aerodynamic wind loading is calculated using the blade element method and the wave loading is computed using the JONSWAP wave spectrum and Morison equation. Dual linear tuned mass dampers (TMDs) deployed in the side-side and fore-aft directions are used for comparison. The NREL monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine is used to examine the performance of 3d-PTMD in a realistic metocean condition.

However, most of existing research in this field focused on unidirectional vibration mitigation, which is insufficient for research and real application. Based on the authors' work (C. Sun and Jahangiri 2018), the present study uses a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3dPTMD) to mitigate the nacelle structural response in the fore-aft and side-side directions under wind, wave and near-fault ground motions. An analytical model of the offshore wind turbine coupled with the 3d-PTMD is established wherein the interaction between the blades and the tower is modelled.

Performance of the 3d-PTMD is examined on a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine under misaligned windwave and near-fault ground motions. The robustness of the mitigation performance of the 3d-PTMD under system variations is studied. Dual linear TMDs are used for comparison. Research results show that the 3d-PTMD responds more rapidly and provides better mitigation of the bi-directional response caused by misaligned wind, wave and near-fault ground motions. Under system variations, the 3d-PTMD is found to be more robust than the dual linear TMDs to overcome the detuning effect. Moreover, the 3dPTMD with a mass ratio of 2\% can mitigate the short-term fatigue damage of the offshore wind turbine tower by up to 90\%.},

These blu! con"gurations have a possibility to generate many types of unfavorable unstable oscillations, such as vortex-induced oscillation, galloping and others. However, thus far these unsteady phenomena with di!erent physical meanings, which can be found in various characteristic behaviors of cylinder-type structures, have not been completely understood.

  abstract = {The phase jump, energy transfer, and the associated vortex shedding modes of a circular cylinder undergoing forced oscillation normal to the incoming uniform flow are investigated numerically at Reynolds number (Re) of 200. The dependence of the fluid forces on the non-dimensional oscillating amplitude A* = A/D 2 [0.1, 0.6] and frequency f* = fe/fs 2 [0.5, 2.0] is examined, where A is the oscillating amplitude, D is the cylinder diameter, fe is the cylinder oscillating frequency, and fs is the Strouhal frequency of fixed cylinder at the same Reynolds number, respectively. The lock-in region is identified by the combination of Fourier analysis and Lissajous phase diagram. The phase difference between displacement and lift fluctuation and the energy transfer between fluid and structure are discussed. Within the lock-in region, a jump in the phase difference is found to occur in the cases with A* = 0.5 and 0.55 without a wake mode transition. The numerical results reveal that the appearance of the phase jump is consistent with the reversal of the energy transfer direction. For the special cases of A* = 0.5 and 0.55, changes in the sign of energy transfer are observed, while no reversal of energy transfer is observed at other amplitudes. The energy transfer direction is either from fluid to cylinder when A* 2 [0.1, 0.4] or from cylinder to fluid when A* 5 0.6. It is confirmed that the energy transfer between fluid and cylinder is not only dependent on cylinder oscillating frequency but also on cylinder oscillating amplitude.},

Within certain frequency ranges a single mode dominates in the wake, consisting of shedding along the entire span of either two vortices per cycle (`2S' mode), or four vortices per cycle (`2P' mode); but within specific parametric ranges a hybrid mode is observed, consisting of a `2S' pattern along the part of the span with the larger diameter and a `2P' pattern along the part of the span with the smaller diameter. A distinct vortex split connects the two patterns which are phase-locked and have the same frequency. The hybrid mode is periodic, unlike vortex dislocations, and the location of the vortex split remains stable and repeatable, within one to two diameters, depending on the amplitude and frequency of oscillation and the Reynolds number.},

  abstract = {The installation process of offshore wind turbines requires the use of expensive jack-up vessels. These vessels regularly report their position via the Automatic Identification System (AIS). This paper introduces a novel approach of applying machine learning to AIS data from jack-up vessels. We apply the new method to 13 offshore wind farms in Danish, German and British waters. For each of the wind farms we identify individual turbine locations, individual installation times, time in transit and time in harbor for the respective vessel. This is done in an automated way exclusively using AIS data with no prior knowledge of turbine locations, thus enabling a detailed description of the entire installation process.},

  year = {2020},

  abstract = {In engineering, a transfer function (also known as system function or network function) of an electronic or control system component is a mathematical function which theoretically models the device's output for each possible input. In its simplest form, this function is a two-dimensional graph of an independent scalar input versus the dependent scalar output, called a transfer curve or characteristic curve. Transfer functions for components are used to design and analyze systems assembled from components, particularly using the block diagram technique, in electronics and control theory. The dimensions and units of the transfer function model the output response of the device for a range of possible inputs. For example, the transfer function of a two-port electronic circuit like an amplifier might be a two-dimensional graph of the scalar voltage at the output as a function of the scalar voltage applied to the input; the transfer function of an electromechanical actuator might be the mechanical displacement of the movable arm as a function of electrical current applied to the device; the transfer function of a photodetector might be the output voltage as a function of the luminous intensity of incident light of a given wavelength. The term "transfer function" is also used in the frequency domain analysis of systems using transform methods such as the Laplace transform; here it means the amplitude of the output as a function of the frequency of the input signal. For example, the transfer function of an electronic filter is the voltage amplitude at the output as a function of the frequency of a constant amplitude sine wave applied to the input. For optical imaging devices, the optical transfer function is the Fourier transform of the point spread function (hence a function of spatial frequency).},

  abstract = {Mooring lines are used to anchor large structures, i.e., prevent them from drifting away from their average position and from performing large-amplitude, low-frequency resonant oscillations. At the same time, the mooring lines are forced to move at the top with the wave-induced motions of the structure, and are subject to flow-induced vibrations.. Cables have complex mechanics of their own, which interact with fluid forces to create several important mechanisms for dynamic tension amplification and generation of damping forces. Recent progress in developing codes for the simulation of cable structures, conceptual developments in the proper modeling of low-tension cables, and the development of experimentally-based models for fluid forces, allows a comprehensive analysis of mooring line dynamics, suitable for design. Because of the superposition of excitation forces of many time scales, the problem becomes tractable for design applications only by separating the equations through an amplitude and time-scale expansion. Three separate equations describe: slowly-varying large amplitude motions, which are very important for studying the resonant motions of a moored structure, wave-induced motions of moderate amplitude, which are important to evaluate the peak dynamic tensions due to the seaway, as well as the drag coefficient amplification caused by nonlinear superposition of slow and wave-induced motions; and very fast, small-amplitude vortex-induced motions, which affect the drag coefficient. All three sets of equations are coupled parametrically; hence analysis is still computationally intensive. Reliable results can be obtained now, which can assist the practicing engineer in choosing optimal configuration.},

  abstract = {The flow-induced vibrations of two elastically mounted circular cylinders subjected to the planar shear flow in tandem arrangement are studied numerically at Re=160. A four-step semi-implicit Characteristic-based split (4-SICBS) finite element method is developed under the framework of the fractional step method to cope with the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) problem. For the computational code verification, two benchmark problems are examined in the laminar region: flow-induced vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder having two degrees of freedom and past two stationary ones in tandem arrangement. Regarding the two-cylinder VIVs in shear flow, the computation is conducted with the cylinder reduced mass Mr=2.5{$\pi$} and the structural damping ratio {$\xi$}=0.0. The effects of some key parameters, such as shear rate (k=0.0, 0.05, 0.1), reduced velocity (Ur=3.0\textendash 18.0) and spacing ratio (Lx/D=2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 8.0), are demonstrated. It is observed that the shear rate and reduced velocity play an important role in the VIVs of both cylinders at various center-to-center distances. Additionally, in comparison with the single cylinder case, a further study indicated that the gap flow has a significant impact on such a dynamic system, leading it to be more complex. The results show that, the performances of `dual-resonant' are discovered in the shear flow. A valley is formed in transverse oscillation amplitude of DC for each spacing ratio when Ur is about 6.0. For the X\textendash Y trajectories of the circular cylinders, figure-eight, figure-O and oval shape are obtained. Finally, the interactions between cylinders are revealed, together with the wake-induced vibration (WIV) mechanism underlying the oscillation characteristics of both cylinders exposed to shear flow. Besides, the ``T+P'' wake pattern is discovered herein.},

Surprisingly, the calculated wind farm wake deflection is the opposite in the two simulations. A momentum balance in the cross flow direction shows that the interaction between the Coriolis force and the 5 \texttimes{} 5 actuator disks is complex due to turbulent mixing of veered momentum from above into the wind farm, which is not observed for the interaction between the Coriolis force and a roughness change. When the wind farm simulations are performed with a horizontally constant Coriolis force in order to isolate the effect of the wind veer, the wind farm wake deflection of the 5 \texttimes{} 5 actuator disks simulation remains unchanged. This proves that the present wind veer deflects the wind farm wake and not the local changes in the Coriolis force in the wake deficit region. An additional simulation of a single actuator disk, operating in a shallow atmospheric boundary layer, confirms that the Coriolis force indirectly turns a wind turbine wake clockwise, as observed from above, due to the presence of a strong wind veer.},

In addition to significant contributions to fatigue actions, dynamic load amplification can govern extreme wind turbine responses. However, current design requirements lack specifications for assessment of resonant loads, particularly during parked or idling conditions where aerodynamic damping contributions are significantly reduced. This study demonstrates a probabilistic approach for assessment of offshore wind turbines under extreme resonant responses during parked situations. Based on in-situ metocean observations on the North Sea, the environmental contour method is used to establish relevant design conditions. A case study on a feasible large monopile design showed that resonant loads can govern the design loads. The presented framework can be applied to assess the reliability of wave-sensitive offshore wind turbine structures for a given site-specific metocean conditions and support structure design.},

  abstract = {Single-blade installation is a conventional method for installing blades on monopile-type offshore wind turbines. A jack-up crane vessel is commonly used, and individual blades are lifted to the tower top height and mated with the hub. The relative motions between the hub and blade root during the mating phase, partly due to wind-induced blade motion and partly due to waveinduced monopile motion, can induce substantial impact forces at the blade root. This can cause severe damage at the blade root connections and have a high potential to jeopardise the installation task. Mitigation measures are therefore required to limit the relative motion between the hub and the root during the mating process. In this article, we investigate the effects of a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) on the (1) impact velocities manifested between the blade root and hub during the mating phase and (2) its effect on the response-based limiting sea states. Timedomain multi-body simulations of an installation system characterising the mating operation with and without a TMD for collinear and misaligned wind and wave conditions have been performed, and the effectiveness of TMD for controlling the impact velocity is quantified. Furthermore, finite element analyses are performed to determine the threshold velocity of impact for a scenario in which a blade root with a guide pin suffers a sideways impact with the hub. It is found that the tuned mass damper can reduce the relative impact velocities by more than 40\% and can sub\- stantially expand the allowable sea states and operability for the mating operation. Moreover, the effectiveness of TMD at reducing the impact velocity increases with increasing significant wave height (Hs); however, it decreases with increasing wind-wave misalignment and with shifts in the wave spectral peak period (Tp) away from the tuned frequency. The findings of the study can be utilised for planning safe and cost-efficient installation of latest-generation wind turbine blades.},

  abstract = {Single-blade installation is a conventional method for installing blades on monopile-type offshore wind turbines. A jack-up crane vessel is commonly used, and individual blades are lifted to the tower top height and mated with the hub. The relative motions between the hub and blade root during the mating phase, partly due to wind-induced blade motion and partly due to waveinduced monopile motion, can induce substantial impact forces at the blade root. This can cause severe damage at the blade root connections and have a high potential to jeopardise the installation task. Mitigation measures are therefore required to limit the relative motion between the hub and the root during the mating process. In this article, we investigate the effects of a passive tuned mass damper (TMD) on the (1) impact velocities manifested between the blade root and hub during the mating phase and (2) its effect on the response-based limiting sea states. Timedomain multi-body simulations of an installation system characterising the mating operation with and without a TMD for collinear and misaligned wind and wave conditions have been performed, and the effectiveness of TMD for controlling the impact velocity is quantified. Furthermore, finite element analyses are performed to determine the threshold velocity of impact for a scenario in which a blade root with a guide pin suffers a sideways impact with the hub. It is found that the tuned mass damper can reduce the relative impact velocities by more than 40\% and can sub\- stantially expand the allowable sea states and operability for the mating operation. Moreover, the effectiveness of TMD at reducing the impact velocity increases with increasing significant wave height (Hs); however, it decreases with increasing wind-wave misalignment and with shifts in the wave spectral peak period (Tp) away from the tuned frequency. The findings of the study can be utilised for planning safe and cost-efficient installation of latest-generation wind turbine blades.},

  abstract = {Most wind turbine blades are assembled piece-by-piece onto the hub of a monopile-type offshore wind turbine using jack-up crane vessels. Despite the stable foundation of the lifting cranes, the mating process exhibits substantial relative responses amidst blade root and hub. These relative motions are combined effects of wave-induced monopile motions and wind-induced blade root motions, which can cause impact loads at the blade root's guide pin in the course of alignment procedure. Environmental parameters including the wind-wave misalignments play an important role for the safety of the installation tasks and govern the impact scenarios. The present study investigates the effects of wind-wave misalignments on the blade root mating process on a monopile-type offshore wind turbine. The dynamic responses including the impact velocities between root and hub in selected wind-wave misalignment conditions are investigated using multibody simulations. Furthermore, based on a finite element study, different impact-induced failure modes at the blade root for sideways and head-on impact scenarios, developed due to wind-wave misalignment conditions, are investigated. Finally, based on extreme value analyses of critical responses, safe domain for the mating task under different wind-wave misalignments is compared. The results show that although misaligned wind-wave conditions develop substantial relative motions between root and hub, aligned wind-wave conditions induce largest impact velocities and develop critical failure modes at a relatively low threshold velocity of impact.},

  abstract = {The growing requirements of large-sized offshore wind turbines require heavier components to be lifted to large heights using installation vessels. This imposes a substantial risk of impact to the lifted components especially when floating crane vessels are used. Floating crane vessels are in general sensitive to wave-induced motion, causing substantial crane tip responses and can lead to significant damage to the lifted blades. Currently, the planning for such weather sensitive operation does not include explicitly the risk of contact/impact or damage in the components to determine the operational limits. This is important for wind turbine blades owing to the fact that they are made of composite materials and are vulnerable to damage from contact/impact loads. The present paper proposes a novel methodology to determine response based operational limit for the blade installation by considering impact loads. Structural damage criteria for the lifted blade under accidental loads are linked with global response analysis of the installation system under stochastic wind and wave loads. A case study is also presented where a wind turbine blade lifted horizontally using jack-up crane vessel impacts the pre-assembled turbine tower with its tip region while being installed under mean wind speed of 10 m/s. It is found that under such conditions, it is safe to install blade from structural damage perspective as the characteristic responses obtained were low to develop any damage in the blade. The findings of the study can be used to derive limiting sea states for blade installation using floating vessels, however a damage tolerance approach requiring residual strength analysis post impact is compulsory.},

  abstract = {Single-blade installation is a popular method for installing blades on bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines. A jackup crane vessel is often employed, and individual blades with their roots equipped with mechanical joints and bolted connections are lifted to the tower-top height and mated with a pre-assembled hub. The final mating phase is challenging and faces significant risks of impact. Due to relative motions between the blade and the hub, substantial impact forces may arise and lead to severe structural damages at root connections, thereby causing delays in the installation task. The present paper considers a realistic scenario of the mating process and investigates the consequences of such impact loads. Here, a single-blade model with tugger lines and a monopile model were established using a multi-body formulation, and relative velocities under collinear wave and wind conditions were obtained. A three-dimensional finite element model was developed for the blade root with Tbolt connections, and an impact investigation was performed for the case in which a guiding connection impacts the hub. The results show severe bending and plastic deformation of the guide pin bolt together with failure of the adjoining composite laminate at the root connection. Based on the type of damage obtained for the different environmental conditions considered, this paper also discusses its consequence on the installation tasks and suggests onboard decision making in case of an impact incident. The results of this study provide new insights regarding the mating phase and can be utilised to establish response-based operational limits.},

The present paper employs the application of high fidelity finite element method to investigate the damage behavior in the blade when the leading edge of the blade hits the tower. A nonlinear time domain structural analysis using ABAQUS was conducted on the DTU 10 MW reference blade model which is based on shell elements.

  abstract = {Abstract             A marine operation is a complex non-routine activity of limited duration carried out in offshore environment. Due to safety reasons, these operations are normally performed within specific sea state limits, which are derived from numerical modelling and analysis of hazardous events. In view of the uncertainties in the assessment of structural responses under stochastic environmental conditions, these limiting curves correspond to a target structural failure probability recommended in offshore standards (for example, 10-4 per operation as specified by DNV-GL). However, one of the main limitations is that these curves do not reflect site-specific safety assessment. The current paper presents a novel methodology for assessing the structural safety level of marine operations from a long-term perspective. The methodology includes estimation of extreme response distribution under all possible operational sea states (i.e. the operational domain under the limiting sea states) for a given offshore site and is compared to the response limit to obtain an average failure probability. A case study is also presented for a blade root mating process onto preassembled hub using a jack-up crane vessel and risk of impact between root and hub is considered critical. Global time-domain simulations are performed using multibody dynamics, and extreme value distributions for impact velocities are derived for different wind-wave conditions. The allowable impact velocity between the blade root and the hub is determined by an explicit finite element analysis of the damage at the blade root. Finally, the average failure probabilities considering the operational domain are obtained for four different European offshore sites and are compared to the target level of structural failure probability considered for the limiting sea states.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing installation of wind turbines in remote locations, both onshore and offshore, advanced fault detection and classification strategies have become crucial to accomplish the required levels of reliability and availability. In this work, without using specific tailored devices for condition monitoring but only increasing the sampling frequency in the already available (in all commercial wind turbines) sensors of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, a data-driven multi-fault detection and classification strategy is developed. An advanced wind turbine benchmark is used. The wind turbine we consider is subject to different types of faults on actuators and sensors. The main challenges of the wind turbine fault detection lie in their non-linearity, unknown disturbances, and significant measurement noise at each sensor. First, the SCADA measurements are pre-processed by group scaling and feature transformation (from the original high-dimensional feature space to a new space with reduced dimensionality) based on multiway principal component analysis through sample-wise unfolding. Then, 10-fold cross-validation support vector machines-based classification is applied. In this work, support vector machines were used as a first choice for fault detection as they have proven their robustness for some particular faults, but at the same time have never accomplished the detection and classification of all the proposed faults considered in this work. To this end, the choice of the features as well as the selection of data are of primary importance. Simulation results showed that all studied faults were detected and classified with an overall accuracy of 98.2\%. Finally, it is noteworthy that the prediction speed allows this strategy to be deployed for online (real-time) condition monitoring in wind turbines.},

The present work uses numerical simulations to study VIVs of a two-dimensional cylinder in the transverse direction under flow conditions that are representative of wind turbine towers both from a fluid dynamics and structural dynamics perspective. First, the numerical tools and fluid\textendash structure interaction algorithm are validated by considering a cylinder vibrating freely in a laminar flow. In that case, both the motion amplitude and frequency are shown to agree well with previous results from the literature. Second, VIVs are modelled in the turbulent supercritical regime using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier\textendash Stokes equations. In this context, the turbulence model is first validated against flow past a stationary cylinder with a high Reynolds number. Then, the results from forced vibrations are validated against experimental results for a range of reduced frequencies and velocities. It is shown that the behaviour of the aerodynamic damping changes with the frequency ratio and can therefore lead to either self-limiting or self-exciting VIVs when the cylinder is left to freely vibrate. Finally, results are shown for a freely vibrating cylinder under realistic flow and structural conditions. While a clear lock-in map is identified and shows good agreement with published numerical and experimental data, the work also highlights the unsteady nature of the aerodynamic forces and motion under certain operating conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A holistic view of the coherency between the approaches in terms of logistics and project performance, taking into consideration the external influence of weather, is provided through analysis of actual projects in the North Sea region. Case study findings reveal the major factors to be pre-assembly, vessel load, and the distance to shore. We suggest a pre-assembly strategy comprised of a minimum number of components for installation onsite and a maximum number of turbines to be loaded on a vessel. These findings are especially important for the new wind farms being positioned further offshore. We show by means of a case study, with specific characteristics and weather conditions, that the appropriate strategies can be arrived at by using a simulation-based decision-support tool we developed.},

  abstract = {The decarbonisation of energy sources requires additional investments in renewable technologies, including the installation of onshore and offshore wind farms. For wind energy to remain competitive, wind farms must continue to provide low-cost power even when covering larger areas. Inside very large wind farms, winds can decrease considerably from their free-stream values to a point where an equilibrium wind speed is reached. The magnitude of this equilibrium wind speed is primarily dependent on the balance between turbine drag force and the downward momentum influx from above the wind farm. We have simulated for neutral atmospheric conditions, the wind speed field inside different wind farms that range from small (25 km(2)) to very large (10(5) km(2)) in three regions with distinct wind speed and roughness conditions. Our results show that the power density of very large wind farms depends on the local free-stream wind speed, the surface characteristics, and the turbine density. In onshore regions with moderate winds the power density of very large wind farms reaches 1 W m(-2), whereas in offshore regions with very strong winds it exceeds 3 W m(-2). Despite a relatively low power density, onshore regions with moderate winds offer potential locations for very large wind farms. In offshore regions, clusters of smaller wind farms are generally preferable; under very strong winds also very large offshore wind farms become efficient.},

Offshore wind energy resources have attracted significant attention, as, compared with land-based wind energy resources, offshore wind energy resources are more promising candidates for development. Sea winds are generally stronger and more reliable and with improvements in technology, the sea has become a hot spot for new designs and installation methods for wind turbines. In the present paper, based on experience building offshore wind farms, recommended foundation styles have been examined. Furthermore, wave effects have been investigated. The split installation and overall installation have been illustrated. Methods appropriate when installing a small number of turbines as well as those useful when installing large numbers of turbines were analyzed. This investigation of installation methods for wind turbines should provide practical technical guidance for their installation.},

  abstract = {The vast availability of wind power has fueled substantial interest in this renewable energy source as a potential near-zero greenhouse gas emission technology for meeting future world energy needs while addressing the climate change issue. However, in order to provide even a fraction of the estimated future energy needs, a large-scale deployment of wind turbines (several million) is required. The consequent environmental impacts, and the inherent reliability of such a large-scale usage of intermittent wind power would have to be carefully assessed, in addition to the need to lower the high current unit wind power costs. Our previous study (Wang and Prinn 2010 Atmos. Chem. Phys. 10 2053) using a three-dimensional climate model suggested that a large deployment of wind turbines over land to meet about 10\% of predicted world energy needs in 2100 could lead to a significant temperature increase in the lower atmosphere over the installed regions. A global-scale perturbation to the general circulation patterns as well as to the cloud and precipitation distribution was also predicted. In the later study reported here, we conducted a set of six additional model simulations using an improved climate model to further address the potential environmental and intermittency issues of large-scale deployment of offshore wind turbines for differing installation areas and spatial densities. In contrast to the previous land installation results, the offshore wind turbine installations are found to cause a surface cooling over the installed offshore regions. This cooling is due principally to the enhanced latent heat flux from the sea surface to lower atmosphere, driven by an increase in turbulent mixing caused by the wind turbines which was not entirely offset by the concurrent reduction of mean wind kinetic energy. We found that the perturbation of the large-scale deployment of offshore wind turbines to the global climate is relatively small compared to the case of land-based installations. However, the intermittency caused by the significant seasonal wind variations over several major offshore sites is substantial, and demands further options to ensure the reliability of large-scale offshore wind power. The method that we used to simulate the offshore wind turbine effect on the lower atmosphere involved simply increasing the ocean surface drag coefficient. While this method is consistent with several detailed fine-scale simulations of wind turbines, it still needs further study to ensure its validity. New field observations of actual wind turbine arrays are definitely required to provide ultimate validation of the model predictions presented here.},

  abstract = {Bionic ribs inspired by those of a cactus are adopted in order to suppress the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) responses of cylinders located near free surfaces. The VIV responses of cactus-inspired cylinders located near free surface are investigated numerically. The range of the Reynolds number is 8.0\,\texttimes\,103 {$\leq$} Re\,{$\leq$}\,5.6\,\texttimes\,104, and the range of the Froude number is 0.08\,{$\leq$}\,Fr\,{$\leq$}\,0.56. The distance between the cylinder and the free surface is 2D (D is diameter of the cylinder), and the cactus-inspired ribs with height ratios (Ks/D, where Ks is the height of the ribs) include 0.0 (M1), 0.025 (M2), 0.05 (M3), and 0.1 (M4). The VIV response of a smooth cylinder (M0) far from a free surface is used as a reference. Different ribs with height ratios have different effects on the VIV responses of cylinders located near free surfaces. The suppression effect of the bionic ribs on the VIV response is largest when Ks/D\,=\,0.1 (M4). The maximum cross-flow amplitude ratio, the maximum in-line amplitude ratio, and the maximum mean drag coefficient of the cactus-inspired cylinder (M4) are 53.57\%, 53.13\%, and 49.21\% lower than that of the smooth cylinder (M1). The cactus-inspired cylinders are easier to desynchronize from the lock-in region. The free surface causes the vortex phase transition to happen earlier. The free surface has a better suppression effect on VIV response in the high Froude number range. When the rib height ratio is small (M2, Ks/D\,=\,0.025), the free surface enhances the VIV response. However, the VIV response is mainly affected by the ribs when the rib height ratio exceeds a certain value (Ks/D\,{$\geq$}\,0.05). When the cactus-inspired rib with height ratio increases, the critical Reynolds number of the vortex phase transition decreases. The free surface and the cactus-inspired ribs are conducive to dissipation of wakes and lead to decreases in the wake turbulence intensity. Because the cactus-inspired ribs can cause the separation line to develop away from the cylinder wall and effectively control the wake intensity, the VIV response of the cactus-inspired cylinder is suppressed effectively. For the cactus-inspired cylinder, galloping responses can be avoided in high-Reynolds-number range, and boundary-layer separation occurs at the top of the ribs. Unlike the boundary-layer separation process of the smooth cylinder (M1), the ribs of the cactus-inspired cylinder destroy the boundary layer, causing smaller vortices to be produced.},

To examine the cause of this underprediction, the OC6 project is using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools to investigate the wave loads on the OC5-DeepCwind semisubmersible, with a focus on the nonlinear difference-frequency excitation. This paper focuses on assessing the uncertainty of the CFD predictions from simulations of the semisubmersible in a fixed condition under bichromatic wave loading and on establishing confidence in the results for use in improving mid-fidelity models. The uncertainty for the nonlinear wave excitation is found to be acceptable but larger than that for the wave-frequency excitation, with the spatial discretization error being the dominant contributor. Further, unwanted free waves at the difference frequency have been identified in the CFD solution. A wave-splitting and wave load-correction procedure are presented to remove the contamination from the free waves in the results. A preliminary comparison to second-order potential-flow theory shows that the CFD model predicted significantly higher difference-frequency wave excitations, especially in surge, suggesting that the CFD results can be used to better calibrate the mid-fidelity tools.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional numerical simulations of flow past two unequal-sized circular cylinders in tandem arrangement are performed at low Reynolds numbers (Re). The upstream larger cylinder is stationary, while the downstream cylinder has both one (transverse-only) and two (transverse and in-line) degrees of freedom (1-dof and 2-dof, respectively). The Re, based on the free stream velocity U{$\infty$} and the downstream cylinder diameter d, varies between 50 and 200 with a wide range of reduced velocities Ur. The diameter of the upstream cylinder is twice that of the downstream cylinder, and the center-to-center spacing is 5.5d. In general, for the 1-dof case, the calculations show that the wake-induced vibrations (WIV) of the downstream cylinder are greatly amplified when compared to the case of a single cylinder or two equal-sized cylinders. The transverse amplitudes build up to a significantly higher level within and beyond the lock-in region, and the Ur associated with the peak amplitude shifts toward a higher value. The dominant wake pattern is 2S mode for Re=50 and 100, while with the increase of Re to 150 and 200, the P+S mode can be clearly observed at some lower Ur. For the 2-dof vibrations, the transverse response characteristics are similar to those presented in the corresponding 1-dof case. The in-line responses are generally much smaller, except for several significant vibrations resulting from in-line resonance. The obvious in-line vibration may induce a C (chaotic) vortex shedding mode for higher Re (Re=200). With regard to the 2-dof motion trajectories, besides the typical figure-eight pattern, several odd patterns such as figure-double eight and single-looped trajectories are also obtained due to the wake interference effect.},

We characterize the storm spectral peak using a Gaussian function in frequency space. These parameters are plotted along two pole-to-pole transects through the Atlantic Ocean at 25\textdegree W and the Pacific Ocean at 170\textdegree W longitude and at 16 current and proposed offshore wind sites. We test the idea that coastal and open-ocean wind statistics may be described by a single set of meridional profiles. In mid-latitudes, the storm band variance exceeding 20 m2 s-2 dominates. The Weibull shape parameter is close to . The storm interval varies from 4 to 7 days depending on location. In the Northern Hemisphere only, the annual variance is significant, exceeding 3 m2 s-2. In the equatorial region, we find steadier winds with small storm variance less than 3 m2 s-2. The Weibull shape parameter is or greater, suggesting the possibility of a high capacity factor there. The storm interval can exceed 15 days. The equatorial zone has an annual wind variance reaching 2 m2 s-2, comparable to the storm variance. In the tropical Pacific, we find interannual variance associated with El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Semidiurnal variance is detected in the tropics from the atmospheric tide.},

  abstract = {The three-dimensional transition of the flow behind a bluff body is studied, with an emphasis placed on the evolution of large-scale structures in the wake. It has previously been found that there are two fundamental modes of three-dimensional vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder (each mode being dependent on the range of Reynolds number), with a spanwise lengthscale of the same order as the primary streamwise wavelength of the vortex street. However. it is shown in the present study that the wake transition also involves the appearance of large-scale spot-like `vortex dislocations', that grow downstream to a size of the order of 10\textendash 20 primary wavelengths. Vortex dislocations are generated between spanwise vortex-shedding cells of different frequency. The presence of these dislocations explains the large intermittent velocity irregularities that were originally found by Roshko (1954) and later by Bloor (1964) to characterize transition. The presence of these vortex dislocations in wake transition is largely responsible for the break-up to turbulence of the wake as it travels downstream.In order to study their evolution in detail, dislocations have been (passively) forced to occur at a local spanwise position with the use of a small ring disturbance. It is found that `two-sided' dislocations are stable in a symmetric in-phase configuration, and that they induce quasi-periodic velocity spectra and (beat) dislocation-frequency oscillations in the near wake. Intrinsic to these dislocations is a mechanism by which they spread rapidly in the spanwise direction, involving helical twisting of the vortices and axial core flows. This is felt to be a fundamental mechanism by which vortices develop large-scale distortions in natural transition. As the wake travels downstream, the energy at the low dislocation frequency decays slowly (in contrast to the rapid decay of other frequencies), leaving the downstream wake dominated by the large dislocation structures. Distinct similarities are found between the periodic forced dislocations and the intermittent dislocations that occur in natural transition. Further similarities of dislocations in different types of flow suggest that vortex or phase dislocations could conceivably be a generic feature of transition in all shear flows.},

  abstract = {Two fundamental characteristics of the low-Reynolds-number cylinder wake, which have involved considerable debate, are first the existence of discontinuities in the Strouhal-Reynolds number relationship, and secondly the phenomenon of oblique vortex shedding. The present paper shows that both of these characteristics of the wake are directly related to each other, and that both are influenced by the boundary conditions at the ends of the cylinder, even for spans of hundreds of diameters in length. It is found that a Strouhal discontinuity exists, which is not due to any of the previously proposed mechanisms, but instead is caused by a transition from one oblique shedding mode to another oblique mode. This transition is explained by a change from one mode where the central flow over the span matches the end boundary conditions to one where the central flow is unable to match the end conditions. In the latter case, quasi-periodic spectra of the velocity fluctuations appear; these are due to the presence of spanwise cells of different frequency. During periods when vortices in neighbouring cells move out of phase with each other, `vortex dislocations' are observed, and are associated with rather complex vortex linking between the cells. However, by manipulating the end boundary conditions, parallel shedding can be induced, which then results in a completely continuous Strouhal curve. It is also universal in the sense that the oblique-shedding Strouhal data (S\texttheta ) can be collapsed onto the parallel-shedding Strouhal curve (S0) by the transformation, S0 = S\texttheta/cos\texttheta, where \texttheta{} is the angle of oblique shedding. Close agreement between measurements in two distinctly different facilities confirms the continuous and universal nature of this Strouhal curve. It is believed that the case of parallel shedding represents truly two-dimensional shedding, and a comparison of Strouhal frequency data is made with several two-dimensional numerical simulations, yielding a large disparity which is not clearly understood. The oblique and parallel modes of vortex shedding are both intrinsic to the flow over a cylinder, and are simply solutions to different problems, because the boundary conditions are different in each case.},

  abstract = {When a body oscillates laterally (cross-flow) in a free stream, it can synchronize the vortex formation frequency with the body motion frequency. This fundamental ``lock-in'' regions is but one in a whole series of synchronization regions, which have been found in the present paper, in an amplitude-wavelength plane (defining the body trajectory) up to amplitudes of five diameters. In the fundamental region, it is shown that the acceleration of the cylinder each half cycle induces the roll-up of the two shear layers close to the body, and thereby the formation of four regions of vorticity each cycle. Below a critical wavelength, each half cycle sees the coalescence of a pair of like-sign vortices and the development of a Karman-type wake. However, beyond this wavelength the like-sign vortices convect away from each other, and each of them pairs with an opposite-sign vortex. The resulting wake comprises a system of vortex pairs which can convect away from the wake centerline. The process of pairing causes the transition between these modes to be sudden, and this explains the sharp change in the character of the cylinder forces observed by Bishop and Hassan, and also the jump in the phase of the lift force relative to body displacement. At precisely the critical wavelength, only two regions of vorticity are formed, and the resulting shed vorticity is more concentrated than at other wavelengths. We interpret this particular case as a condition of ``resonant synchronization'', and it corresponds with the peak in the body forces observed in Bishop and Hassan's work.},

We present new vortex wake modes, generally in the framework of a map of vortex modes compiled from forced vibration studies, some of which cause free vibration. Some discussion focuses on topics of current debate, such as the decomposition of force, the relevance of the paradigm flow of an elastically mounted cylinder to more complex systems, and the relationship between forced and free vibration.},

As with any expanding industry, there are concerns regarding the potential environmental effects which may be caused by the installation of the offshore wind turbines and their associated infrastructure, including substations and subsea cables. These include the potential impacts on the biological, physical and human environments. This review discusses in detail the potential impacts arising from offshore wind farm construction, and how these may be quantified and addressed through the use of conceptual models. It concludes that while not environmentally benign, the environmental impacts are minor and can be mitigated through good siting practices. In addition, it suggests that there are opportunities for environmental benefits through habitat creation and conservation protection areas.},

Abstract Offshore wind farms will have larger capacities in the future than they do today. Thus, the costs that are associated with the installation of wind turbines and the connection of power grids will be much higher, thus the location of wind turbines and the design of internal cable connections will be even more important. A large wind farm comprises of hundreds of wind turbines. Modeling each using a complex model leads to long simulation timesespecially in transient response analyses. Therefore, in the future, simulations of power systems with a high wind power penetration must apply the equivalent wind-farm model to reduce the burden of calculation. This investigation examines significant issues around the optimal design of a modern offshore wind farm layout and its equivalent model. According to a review of the literature, the wake effect and its modeling, layout optimization technologies, cable connection design, and wind farm reliability, are significant issues in offshore wind farm design. This investigation will summarize these important issues and present a list of factors that strongly influence the design of an offshore wind farm.},

  abstract = {In the present study, a detailed assessment investigation of Very-Large Eddy Simulation (VLES) method is performed using the open-source toolbox OpenFOAM for the simulation of turbulent separated flow. The VLES method is a unified simulation approach enabling a seamless evolution from Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to quasi Direct Numerical Simulation (quasi-DNS) depending on the numerical resolution. Two VLES models, i.e. VLES-k-{$\epsilon$} and VLES-k-{$\omega$}, are implemented in OpenFOAM and applied in the present study. In order to assess the performance of VLES models based on the framework of OpenFOAM, four classic separated flow are selected and investigated in details, including the flow past a triangular bluff body at Re~\mbox =~\mbox 45,000, the flow past a backward facing step at Re~\mbox =~\mbox 40,000, the periodic hill flow at Re~\mbox =~\mbox 10,595, and the flow past a circular cylinder at Re~\mbox =~\mbox 41,300. The comparisons between VLES simulation results and experiments give an indication on the adequacy and accuracy of the VLES modelling method based on the OpenFOAM toolbox. The VLES-k-{$\omega$} model performs slightly better than the VLES-k-{$\epsilon$} model on a relatively low mesh resolution, especially in predicting the turbulent separation flow induced by the pressure gradient on a smooth surface. The results also demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of the VLES modelling based on OpenFOAM platform for complex separated flow simulations.},

  abstract = {A new method for designing wind turbine airfoils is presented in this paper. As a main component in the design method, airfoil profiles are expressed in a trigonometric series form using conformal transformations and series of polynomial equations. The characteristics of the coefficient parameters in the trigonometric expression for airfoils profiles are first studied. As a direct consequence, three generic airfoil profiles are obtained from the expression. To validate and show the generality of the trigonometric expression, the profiles of the NACA 64418 and S809 airfoils are expressed by the present expression. Using the trigonometric expression for airfoil profiles, a so-called integrated design method is developed for designing wind turbine airfoils. As airfoil shapes are expressed with analytical functions, the airfoil surface can be kept smooth in a high degree. In the optimization step, drag and lift force coefficients are calculated using the XFOIL code. Three new airfoils CQ-A15, CQ-A18, and CQ-A21 with a thickness of 15\%, 18\%, and 21\%, respectively, are designed with the new integrated design method.},

  abstract = {Wind turbines are being increasingly deployed in remote onshore and offshore areas due to the richer wind resource there and the advantages of mitigating the land use and visual impact issues. However, site accessing difficulties and the shortage of proper transportation and installation vehicles/vessels are challenging the operation and maintenance of the giants erected at these remote sites. In addition to the continual pressure on lowering the cost of energy of wind, condition monitoring is being regarded as one of the best solutions for the maintenance issues and therefore is attracting significant interest today. Much effort has been made in developing wind turbine condition monitoring systems and inventing dedicated condition monitoring technologies. However, the high cost and the various capability limitations of available achievements have delayed their extensive use. A cost-effective and reliable wind turbine condition monitoring technique is still sought for today. The purpose of this paper is to develop such a technique through interpreting the SCADA data collected from wind turbines, which have already been collected but have long been ignored due to lack of appropriate data interpretation tools. The major contributions of this paper include: (1) develop an effective method for processing raw SCADA data; (2) propose an alternative condition monitoring technique based on investigating the correlations among relevant SCADA data; and (3) realise the quantitative assessment of the health condition of a turbine under varying operational conditions. Both laboratory and site verification tests have been conducted. It has been shown that the proposed technique not only has a potential powerful capability in detecting incipient wind turbine blade and drive train faults, but also exhibits an amazing ability in tracing their further deterioration.

For comparison, a smooth cylinder was also considered. The present flow statistics for the smooth cylinder are quite consistent with previous findings at Reynolds numbers of Re = 3900/4000 and 10 000 that were obtained by combining particle image velocimetry measurements and direct numerical simulations [Dong et al., "A combined direct numerical simulation-particle image velocity study of the turbulent near wake," J. Fluid Mech. 569, 185-207 (2006)]. The mean drag and root mean square (RMS) lift coefficients had almost linear relations with Re. The HTE geometry showed more effective performance for the reduction of the drag and the RMS lift coefficients with increasing Re. The RMS streamwise velocity for the HTE cylinder appeared different from that of the smooth cylinder. The HTE cylinder lacked RMS streamwise velocity behind the cylinder base, indicating small magnitudes of the fluctuations. In general, the tip of the mean vorticity layer for the HTE cylinder is thinner than that for the smooth cylinder. The thickness of mean vorticity layer depends on the spanwise direction rather than Re. Also, the tips of contours of the Reynolds stress are much sharper with increasing Re and approach the separation position of the cylinder surface. The elongated vortex formation length decreases almost linearly with Re. Published under license by AIP Publishing.},

  abstract = {Flow interference between two circular cylinders in various arrangements imposes continuous and discontinuous changes in vortex shedding. The resulting oscillations induced by the vortex shedding are considerably modified by and strongly depend on the arrangement of the two cylinders. A systematic classification of flow interference regimes is linked to the observed vortex shedding responses for a wide range of arrangements. The discontinuous change of flow regimes in some arrangements can excite and maintain large amplitude oscillations beyond a certain critical velocity. The critical velocity and magnitude of oscillation strongly depends on the initial location and subsequent displacement of the cylinder by the fluid-elastic forces. The wide variety of fluid-elastic responses can be categorized at least into three characteristic types for two cylinders with identical properties: (1) instability rapidly builds up to extremely large amplitude predominantly in the streamwise direction; (2) instability slowly builds up amplitude to a certain level, the oscillations being mostly in the streamwise direction; (3) instability gradually builds up to large amplitude predominantly in the transverse direction. It has been found that all types of the fluid-elastic oscillations were related to the regions of interference.},

The three categories are as follows: 1.(i) surface protrusions, which affect separation lines and/or separated shear layers, e.g. helical strakes, wires, fins, studs or spheres, etc.;2.(ii) shrouds, which affect the entrainment layers, e.g. perforated, gauze, axial-rod, axial-slat, etc.;(iii) nearwake stabilisers, which prevent interaction of entrainment layers, e.g. splitter plates, guiding vanes, base-bleed, slits cut across the cylinder, etc . Most means in the first two categories are omnidirectional, i.e. they are effective irrespective of the direction of fluid velocity. Some means in the first and all in the third category are unidirectional, i.e. they are effective only for one velocity direction. All means are described in detail and the reasons for their effectiveness explained. A comparative assessment of effectiveness is attempted and the need for comparative tests of various means under identical model conditions is stressed. The reduction of effectiveness in the post-synchronisation range, at high intensity of turbulence, and due to multi-cylinder interference is emphasised.},

This measurement approach is advantageous as no modification to the turbine is required. The tower deflections are measured simultaneously with measurements of wind speed and turbulence upstream of the turbine and of turbine parameters (blade pitch angle, rotor torque and rotor speed). Measurements show that tower deflections during normal operation are sensitive to the yaw misalignment of the rotor, and the tower deflections with negative yaw misalignment are seen to be larger than with positive yaw misalignment. The tower deflections during power cut-off and normal operation are, respectively, modeled with free and forced vibration single-degree-of-freedom models to calculate the damping ratio. The damping ratio during power cut-off, 6.8\%, is in the lower range of damping ratios that are measured during normal operation, 5.5\%\textendash 13.2\%. These findings suggest that blade pitch and rotor torque can be used to alleviate the unsteady structural loads caused by the lightly damped oscillations during transition to power cutoff. Additionally, positive yaw misalignments can be used as a strategy for load alleviation during normal operation of wind turbines.},

The experimental Reynolds number ranges from 22,000 to 88,000. The in-line gap L is set as 3.0D, 3.6D, 4.2D and 5.5D in turn, and the cross-flow gap T is set as 0.7D, 1.1D, 1.5D, 1.9D, 2.3D and 2.7D, respectively. By measuring the vibrating response in model test, the response differences between the two staggered cylinders and the isolated cylinder and the effects of the gaps are discussed. The results indicate that the variation trend of response of the upstream cylinder with reduced velocity is basically similar to that of the isolated cylinder. However, the downstream cylinder shows some great differences. When the in-line gap ratio L/D is 3.6, the cross-flow amplitude curve of downstream cylinder changes from ``single peak'' to ``double peaks'' with the increase in cross-flow gap ratio T/D, and in-line amplitude curve even shows four different kinds of forms. When L/D is increasing, maximum amplitudes of the downstream cylinder in two directions also show an increasing trend, and the wake galloping phenomenon even appears in some conditions. Generally, the case of staggered cylinders is a generalized combination of two circular cylinders in tandem and side-by-side arrangements, and this article has extended the research scope of the double-cylinder vortex-induced vibration to arbitrary flow direction.},

An analysis in the frequency domain and time domain was conducted considering the effects of draft, speed, and wave height on the towing stability of the wind turbine transportation vessel. The results show that the one-step integrated transportation method can ensure stability of the wind turbine during the towing process. Reducing draft, increasing speed, and increasing wave height will reduce the towing stability of the wind turbine. In the practical towing process, the combination of various adverse situations will be avoided.},

  abstract = {Floating structures have become the most feasible solution for supporting wind turbines when offshore wind project move to deeper water. In this paper, a hydrodynamic analysis of three different semisubmersible floating offshore wind turbines is carried out including second-order hydrodynamic effects. The three examined platforms are V-shaped semisubmersible, Braceless semisubmersible and OC4-DeepCwind semisubmersible and are used to support the NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine. The main objective of the present study is to investigate and compare the hydrodynamic response of the three different semisubmersible floaters in two water depths (100 m, and 200 m) under different load conditions. The effects of second-order wave loads on the platform motions and mooring tension are discussed and compared by using different methods including Newman's approximation and the full QTF (Quadratic transfer function) method. The drag effect on the structure motion response is also discussed in this paper. The comparison presented is based on statistical values and response spectra of floating platform motions as well as mooring tensions. The results show that the dynamic response of semisubmersible FOWTs (floating offshore wind turbines) is overestimated when ignoring the Morison drag effect on the columns of the semisubmersible FOWT. The second-order difference wave loads can excite the resonance of motion especially for the platform-pitch motion, which could cause structural failures. The full QTF method should be used to calculate the second-order wave force to better simulate the realistic dynamic response of semi\- submersible FOWTs.},

They are thus a promising alternative to install offshore wind turbine components, especially in intermediate and deep water. However, the wave-induced motions of the floating vessels make the operations challenging. This study deals with a preliminary feasibility study on offshore single blade installation using floating crane vessels. Two typical floating crane vessels are considered, i.e., a mono-hull vessel and a semi-submersible vessel. They are assumed to be equipped with dynamic positioning systems that can well mitigate the slowly varying horizontal motions. Their overall performance during the blade installation is numerically evaluated by comparing their performance against a typical jack-up crane vessel. The crane dynamics plays a less important role for blade installation by floating vessels, compared to the jack-up crane vessel. The floating vessels' wave-induced motion greatly affects the blade motion. The semi-submersible vessel causes a much smaller blade motion than the mono-hull vessel. The results indicate that it is feasible to install offshore wind turbine blades by using floating crane vessels provided that the vessel type is properly selected. From the operability point of view, semi-submersible vessels are more feasible than mono-hull vessels for offshore single blade installations.},

Different configurations have different aerodynamic performance and it is important to predict the performance of both downwind and upwind configurations accurately for designing and developing more reliable wind turbines. In this paper, a numerical investigation on the aerodynamic performance of National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) phase VI wind turbine in downwind and upwind configurations is presented. The open source toolbox OpenFOAM coupled with arbitrary mesh interface (AMI) method is applied to tackle rotating problems of wind turbines. Two 3D numerical models of NREL phase VI wind turbine with downwind and upwind configurations under four typical working conditions of incoming wind velocities are set up for the study of different unsteady characteristics of the downwind and upwind configurations, respectively. Numerical results of wake vortex structure, time histories of thrust, pressure distribution on the blade and limiting streamlines which can be used to identify points of separation in a 3D flow are presented. It can be concluded that thrust reduction due to blade-tower interaction is small for upwind wind turbines but relatively large for downwind wind turbines and attention should be paid to the vibration at a certain frequency induced by the cyclic reduction for both configurations. The results and conclusions are helpful to analyze the different aerodynamic performance of wind turbines between downwind and upwind configurations, providing useful references for practical design of wind turbine.},

Moreover, comparative studies using two types of installation vessels, a floating vessel and a Jack-up, are investigated for the lowering process. Critical responses including the motions of the tripod and the lift wire tensions are presented and compared under various environmental and loading conditions.},

  abstract = {Operators need accurate knowledge on structural reserves to decide about lifetime extension of offshore wind turbines. Load monitoring enables us to directly compare design loads with real loading histories of the support structure in order to calculate its remaining useful lifetime. Monitoring of every hot spot is technically and financially not feasible. This paper presents a novel idea for load monitoring of monopiles. ft requires strain measurements at only one level convenient for sensor installation, such as tower bottom. Measurements are converted into damage equivalent loads for 10min time intervals. Damage equivalent loads are extrapolated to other locations of the structure with a simulation model and statistical algorithm. For this, structural loads at all locations of the monopile are calculated with aero-hydro-elastic software and updated finite element models. Damage equivalent loads at unmeasured locations are predicted from the simulation results with a kappa-nearest neighbor regression algorithm. The extrapolation was tested with numerical simulations of an 8 MW offshore wind turbine. Results show that damage can be predicted with an error of 1-3 \% if this is done conditional on mean wind speed, which is very promising. The load monitoring concept is simple, cheap and easy to implement. This makes it ideal for making decisions on lifetime extension of monopiles.},

  abstract = {Offshore wind turbines are vulnerable to external vibration sources such as wind and wave excitations due to the increasing size and flexibility. It is necessary to mitigate the excessive vibrations of offshore wind turbines to ensure the safety and serviceability during their operations. Some research works have been carried out to control the excessive vibrations of the tower and the in-plane vibrations of blades. Very limited study focuses on the out-of-plane vibration mitigation of blades. In the present study, a detailed finite element (FE) model of the latest NREL 5MW wind turbine is developed by using the FE code ABAQUS. The tower and blades are explicitly modelled, and the rotating of the blades is considered. Multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) are proposed to be installed in the tower and each blade to simultaneously mitigate the out-of-plane vibrations of the tower and blades when the wind turbine is subjected to the combined wind and wave loadings. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method are systematically investigated. Numerical results show that MTMDs can effectively mitigate the out-of-plane vibrations of the tower and blades when the wind turbine is in either the operational or parked condition.},

  abstract = {Wind energy as one of the renewable energies is serving as an indispensable role in generating new electric power. The worldwide installation of wind farms has considerably increased recently. To extract more wind resources, multi-megawatt wind turbines are usually designed and constructed with large rotors and slender tower. These flexible structures are susceptible to external dynamic excitations such as wind, wave and seismic loads. The excessive vibrations can compromise the wind energy conversion, lead to the structural fatigue damage and even result in the catastrophic failure of wind turbines in harsh environmental conditions. Various control devices have been proposed and used to mitigate the unwanted vibrations of wind turbines to enhance their safety and serviceability. This paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art review of the current vibration control techniques and their applications to wind turbines. Firstly, the widely used control strategies in engi\- neering structures are briefly introduced. Their applications to suppress the adverse vibrations of the structural components of wind turbines, mainly the tower and blades, are then reviewed and discussed in detail. It can be concluded that the vibration mitigation of wind turbines is very challenging due to the fact that the dynamic behaviours of wind turbines are very complicated, which are associated with the aerodynamics, rotation of the blades, interaction between the tower and rotating blades, and soil-structure interaction, etc. Moreover, it is a challenge to straightforwardly use many of the conventional control devices because of the limited spaces in the tower and blades.},
